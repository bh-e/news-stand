But a deeper scrutiny reveals the tourists landed barely 24 hours before their fixture, jet-lagged.</p><p>Also, critics complain that while the FIFA rankings often provide a far from accurate picture -- as exemplified by Belgium last year when they rose to second place behind Germany -- the concept looks fundamentally flawed in assessing teams like India which play very few international matches.</p><p>The men's U-23 team failed to get past Nepal in the South Asian Games losing 1-2 in the final, but the eves fared better, thrashing the same opponent 4-0 to win the same competition.</p><p><img src="http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/dec2016/dada_atk.jpg"><br></p><p>In the domestic arena, Atletico de Kolkata remained the most consistent team of the ISL by clinching their second title in the three years of the competition.</p><p>Under coach Jose Molina, the franchise drew eight times in the league -- the highest at that stage in all three seasons -- to win the crown leapfrogging Mumbai City FC and Kerala Blasters in the semifinal and final, respectively.</p><p>But overall, the standards of the eight-team meet dropped with boring games ruling the roost.</p><p>The ISL -- which according to the AIFF and ISL operators FSDL will be the top league with no relegation after the U-17 World Cup -- was also the reason Goan clubs pulled the plug on their league stints.</p><p>Five-time I-League winners Dempo, 60-year-old club Salgaocar and Sporting Clube de Goa decided to walk away from the league during the year, which also saw Mohun Bagan annexing the Federation Cup and Services claiming the Santosh Trophy.</p><p>Looking ahead, a lot is riding on the Indian U-16 colts preparing for the junior World Cup which the country is set to host for the first time. The boys, under German coach Nicolai Adam, have been very impressive, their performance against Brazil in the BRICS Cup being the crowning moment.</p><p>All eyes will be on the showpiece event in October next year and even hard-nosed critics agree that it will give a face-lift to Indian football.</p><p><img src="http://im.sify.com/sifyhome2011/images/dec2016/ronaldo_euro.jpg&#10;"><br></p><p>Elsewhere, Portugal got a major boost by winning the European Championships this summer in France. Not just did Cristiano Ronaldo pip his eternal rival Lionel Messi in the medal count for the country by winning his first piece of silverware, the fact that they upset the more fancied hosts took everyone by surprise.</p><p>Messi, on the other hand, suffered the ignominy of another title snub at the final hurdle at Copa America, as Argentina lost to Chile on penalties with the talisman infamously skying his spot kick. The FC Barcelona star retired from international football in disgust -- only to announce a comeback months later.</p><p>Ronaldo continued his march, winning a fourth Ballon d'Or crown after also helping Real Madrid win the Champions League.</p><p>In another miracle story, Leicester City defied all odds to lift the Premier League despite being 5,000-1 outsiders to do the implausible.</p><p>Off the pitch, disgraced FIFA president Sepp Blatter and his one-time heir apparent Michel Platini were banned from football for eight years, throwing the game into dark territories.</p><p><i>Stay updated

Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming a fourth Ballon d'Or award on Monday after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.<p>Ronaldo is one short of the record tally of five awards won by Barcelona's Argentina forward Lionel Messi, who was second with the pair having taken the first two spots since 2011.</p><p>"For me it's a great honour to receive my fourth golden ball. The emotion is like for the first one, it's a dream come true again. I never thought in my mind to win four times. I'm so happy," said Ronaldo, who won the award in 2008, 2013 and 2014.</p><p>"It's probably the best year of my career collectively, with Real Madrid and Portugal.</p><p>"Real are used to winning titles while Portugal had never won a major title so this (Euro 2016) title is special. I don't want to lack respect to the Champions League but the title with Portugal is a level above."</p><p>The Ballon d'Or, which merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award from 2010-15 to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or, returned to France Football magazine this year.</p><p>A total of 173 journalists voted but not national team coaches and captains who were also polled for the FIFA award.</p><p><b>CUT ABOVE</b></p><p>France and Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann, who lost to Ronaldo's Portugal and Real in the Euro 2016 and Champions League finals respectively, took third place.</p><p>Uruguay forward Luis Suarez was fourth and Brazil's Neymar fifth, giving Barcelona three players in the top five.</p><p>Ronaldo was a cut above the competition, though. </p><p>FACT BOX Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo </p><p>He scored 51 goals in 54 games for club and country, albeit his lowest tally since 2008, claimed another Champions League winners' medal and lifted the European Championship trophy.</p><p>Ronaldo limped off midway through the first half of July's Euro 2016 final, which Portugal won 1-0 after extra time against hosts France, but he hobbled back onto the pitch to celebrate his country's first major soccer title.</p><p>Six weeks earlier, after a fairly anonymous performance against local rivals Atletico in the Champions League final, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout to hand Real their 11th European Cup.</p><p>It was, therefore, hard to see past 31-year-old Ronaldo for the winner of the Ballon d'Or, even if the trophy is designed to reward individual performance rather than team results.</p><p><i>Stay updated on the go with Sify Live Scores App. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/de&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;tails?id=com.sify.sports">Click here to download it for your device</a></i></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:112:"http://www.sify.com/sports/ronaldos-golden-year-rewarded-with-fourth-ballon-dor-news-football-qmnsQofjcbfjf.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:122:"http://www.sify.com/sports/brazil-mourns-chapecoense-crash-victims-at-packed-stadium-wake-news-football-qmelUAjhhhigf.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 04 Dec 2016 11:56:36 +0530";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"Brazil mourns Chapecoense crash victims at packed stadium wake";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:6:"length";s:3:"100";s:4:"type";s:7:"image/*";s:3:"url";s:50:"http://static.sify.com/cms/image/qmelThiiijieh.jpg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4367:"A downpour drenched thousands of mourners in this Brazilian city on Saturday as they grieved over 50 caskets flown overnight to the stadium of the local Chapecoense soccer team, which was all but wiped out in an air crash Monday in Colombia.<p>An arena filled with banners and team faithful donning its green and white colors served as an open-air wake for locals. Just a week ago, they were braced to celebrate the plucky squad, which had ascended from minor leagues in recent years to reach the final of a major South American tournament.</p><p>Instead, they looked on as Air Force troops, after unloading the bodies from cargo aircraft, ferried the caskets to makeshift tents erected on the team's soggy home turf, where victims' families sat in sorrow.</p><p>President Michel Temer, who flew in from Brazil's capital at dawn to receive the caskets at a Chapeco airfield, bestowed posthumous honors on the deceased athletes.</p><p>"This event, as you know, shook the whole country," Temer told reporters in brief comments before making the short drive to the stadium, where he remained silent for the rest of the emotional tribute. "This rain must be Saint Peter crying."</p><p>Monday's disaster, which killed 71 passengers and crew, shocked soccer fans the world over and plunged Brazil into mourning. A BAe146 regional airliner operated by Bolivian charter company LAMIA had radioed that it was running out of fuel before smashing into a hillside outside Medellin, Colombia.</p><p>Only six people survived, including just three members of the club, en route to the Copa Sudamericana final, the biggest game in its history. Earlier on Saturday, the bodies of eight journalists who also died in the crash arrived in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Victims' families in recent days have been outraged by reports that the plane, which circled for 16 minutes while another aircraft emergency landed, had barely enough fuel for the flight.</p><p>Bolivian President Evo Morales has pledged to take "drastic measures" to determine the cause. Bolivia has suspended LAMIA's operating license and replaced the national aviation authority's management.</p><p>In Chapeco, a small agricultural city, dozens of fans kept vigil overnight at the stadium, where an impromptu shrine swelled with fresh flowers and handmade posters.</p><p>By Saturday afternoon, thousands more gathered, cheering and applauding as the caskets arrived. Visitors from other parts of Brazil joined locals, waving flags of other teams in solidarity.</p><p>The ceremony, at times solemn and at times raucous, was "as informal as formality would allow," said an announcer, thanking those who packed the 20,000 capacity stadium to chant and sing in breaks between speeches, tributes and prayers.</p><p>In Chapeco, a small agricultural city, dozens of fans kept vigil overnight at the stadium, where an impromptu shrine swelled with fresh flowers and handmade posters.</p><p>By Saturday afternoon, thousands more gathered, cheering and applauding as the caskets arrived.
