<p><span id="more-4905"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. The party would like to know when your data leaves the country.</strong> The Chinese government has drafted a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-moves-to-further-tighten-regulation-of-digital-information-1491911085">new regulation on internet security</a> that would require internet operators doing business in China to receive approval before transferring data outside of the country. The draft regulation would vest internet regulators and public security officials with the power to block data from leaving the country if the data in question contains personal information, or sensitive information related to national security. The Cyberspace Administration of China said the new rules&#8211;which would be <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/11/china_emerges_as_digital_rights_champion_with_new_data_law/">the world&#8217;s strictest data portability rules</a>&#8211;are intended to “protect internet sovereignty,” but several <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-intel-ibm-push-back-on-china-cybersecurity-rules-1480587542">U.S. tech giants</a> are concerned that the broadening of the existing data-localization requirements would only complicate their operations in China.</p>
<p><strong>2. We, the undersigned, declare&#8230; </strong>G7 foreign ministers issued a declaration on what they believe is <a href="http://www.esteri.it/mae/resource/doc/2017/04/declaration_on_cyberspace.pdf">responsible state behavior in cyberspace</a>. The document mostly repeats existing G7 commitments to respect rights online, abide by international law and the peacetime norms issued in the <a href="https://ccdcoe.org/2015-un-gge-report-major-players-recommending-norms-behaviour-highlighting-aspects-international-l-0.html">2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts report</a>, and support the development of confidence building measures. Interestingly, the declaration notes that a state is &#8220;free to make its own determination &#8230; with respect to attribution of a cyber-act to another state.&#8221; That line drew <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/04/13/growing-consensus-need-international-treaty-nation-state-attacks/#sm.0001p5mtos1ag1f8fxwei5yeeva6f">mild criticism</a> from Microsoft President Brad Smith, who has <a href="http://www.cfr.org/cybersecurity/promoting-norms-cyberspace/p36358">joined others</a> to argue for the creation of an attribution body&#8211;something akin to an <a href="https://mscorpmedia.azureedge.net/mscorpmedia/2017/04/Policy-Paper-Attribution-Organization.pdf">International Atomic Energy Agency for cyberspace</a>&#8211;that would independently assess the facts of a cyber incident and identify who was behind it.</p>
<p><strong>3. Could the United States and Russia cooperate on cybercrime? </strong>After his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mentioned that both parties are “<a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-cybersecurity/2017/04/cia-director-makes-first-big-public-appearance-today-219756">interested in close cooperation on cybercrime.</a>” That might come as a surprise to some given that Moscow is known to <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2017/03/15/hacking-charges-against-russian-fsb-officers-a-quick-reaction/">leverage its criminal underground</a> to conduct is cyber espionage activities, and might therefore be reluctant to hand over fugitives. Nevertheless, there is precedent for cyber cooperation between both countries. The United States and Russia agreed to a <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/17/fact-sheet-us-russian-cooperation-information-and-communications-technol">series of bilateral confidence building measures</a> in 2013, and the U.S.-China <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/third-us-china-high-level-joint-dialogue-cybercrime-and-related-issues">mechanism on cybercrime cooperation</a> has been successful&#8211;possibly providing a template for U.S.-Russian efforts. In addition, Kimberly Marten, the director of the U.S.-Russia program at Columbia University&#8217;s Harriman Institute, <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/27/trump-ties-to-russia-hacks/">argues</a> that Washington and Moscow start building trust in the cyberspace by agreeing to not reveal personal or compromising information about each others&#8217; leaders&#8211;a practice known as doxing.</p>
<p><strong>4. More Shadow Brokers. </strong>The Shadow Brokers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/nsa-leaking-shadow-brokers-just-dumped-its-most-damaging-release-yet/">released</a> another round of what is believed to be National Security Agency (NSA) cyber tools and related data. <em>Wired</em> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/major-leak-suggests-nsa-deep-middle-east-banking-system/">reports</a> that the leaked data shows that the NSA may have compromised EastNets, a company that oversees payments in the SWIFT network for clients in the Middle East. The NSA operation seems to be more run-of-the-mill espionage, as opposed to an effort to steal money as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/25/technology/north-korea-hackers-global-banks.html?_r=1&amp;mtrref=t.co&amp;gwh=C86F7048C9E5FE566F2582A25A2F6787&amp;gwt=pay">North Korea allegedly did</a> with its compromise of Bangladesh bank. However, the leak raises important questions. Nicholas Weaver at <em>Lawfare </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/25/technology/north-korea-hackers-global-banks.html?_r=1&amp;mtrref=t.co&amp;gwh=C86F7048C9E5FE566F2582A25A2F6787&amp;gwt=pay">points out</a> the Shadow Brokers release shows that the NSA did not disclose zero-days to vendors after they potentially knew they were compromised. Over at <em>Medium, </em>security researcher Matt Suiche <a href="https://medium.com/@msuiche/the-nsa-compromised-swift-network-50ec3000b195">makes the case</a> that a U.S. compromise of the SWIFT network could bolster Russia and China&#8217;s efforts to build support for alternate transfer mechanisms.</p>

<p><span id="more-4893"></span></p>
<p>Last month, INTERPOL cybercrime experts travelled to Sri Lanka to advise local police officers on cybercrime investigations and the development of digital forensics capabilities. Similar workshops have slowly been set up in various countries where digital infrastructures are being developed, and they are a crucial step to increase the security and resilience of tomorrow’s digital global landscape.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2016.pdf">more than half</a> of the world’s population is still offline, large-scale efforts are currently directed at extending internet connectivity in order to bridge the digital divide. Yet, massively expanding connectivity also increases the cybersecurity risk individuals and organizations face.</p>
<p>Neglecting cybersecurity has negative consequences on two fronts. First, developing countries will not be able to reap the full benefits of information and communication technologies (ICTs) if security considerations are not taken into account. These nations, which are expanding access rapidly, will be especially vulnerable to cybercrime, data breaches, and attacks on critical infrastructures if their systems are insecure from the start. There even are real concerns that attacks have the potential to take entire countries offline, as was the case in an alleged <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/analysts-mixed-on-reason-for-liberia-mirai-attack/article/570970/">recent denial of service attack</a> on Liberia’s internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>Second, insecure infrastructure in the developing world can have negative impacts on developed nations. In an increasingly interconnected digital ecosystem, insecure networks in one place can be abused to disrupt infrastructure around the globe. Similarly, without effective domestic law enforcement capabilities, safe havens for cybercrime can arise. As more users and devices go online, the potential for cross-border problems is increasing exponentially.</p>
<p>These developments should push all countries to improve the resilience of the weakest systems connected to the internet. Cybersecurity capacity building (CCB) is critical to this effort. CCB initiatives encompass a broad set of activities, such as supporting governments in developing national cybersecurity strategies or enhancing the technical capabilities of local CSIRTs. A number of maturity models have been developed to assess and benchmark cybersecurity capacity, and the <a href="https://www.thegfce.com/">Global Forum for Cyber Expertise (GFCE)</a> was created as a first attempt to exchange and pool international expertise on CCB. The <a href="https://www.un.org/disarmament/topics/informationsecurity/">UN GGE</a> has <a href="https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/UN-150722-GGEReport2015.pdf">pointed</a> to CCB as a means to “bridge the divide in the security of ICTs and their use.”</p>
<p>Despite an engaged community of experts and an increasing number of projects, present efforts still fall short of what is needed to transform cybersecurity from an afterthought into an integral part of expanding connectivity. Initiatives are often under-funded and uncoordinated—both within and between countries—and only few best practices have been identified. In addition to gaps in capacity, there is little exchange—let alone integration—between cybersecurity experts, development actors and diplomats. As a result, awareness of capacity building pitfalls that have plagued efforts in other areas is increasing only slowly.</p>
<p>In a new<a href="http://www.gppi.net/publications/data-technology-politics/article/advancing-cybersecurity-capacity-building-implementing-a-principle-based-approach/"> report</a>, we make the case that these gaps can be addressed in three ways.</p>
<p>First, cybersecurity and international development experts must integrate their efforts. Otherwise, increases in connectivity, aided by development funding, are likely to outpace the resilience of the networks being connected. At the same time, cybersecurity professionals run the risk of failing to incorporate the strategies—honed over decades—that make development programs work.</p>
<p>Second, coordination and cooperation among donors must improve. Most donor countries have taken a piecemeal approach to CCB. Improved coordination at the international level, such as through the GFCE, is necessary to avoid duplication and to facilitate exchange. Efforts should include civil society, academia and the private sector, as government-led efforts will not be sustainable unless they are not linked to actors on the ground over the long term.</p>
<p>Third, continued and mutual learning is crucial to future efforts. Given that CCB efforts are still relatively new, there is little knowledge on what strategies have worked and why. Although a lack of successful projects should not deter action, there is a need to be transparent about whether a particular initiative was successful. That requires developing benchmarks and best practices. Existing maturity models such as the <a href="http://www.potomacinstitute.org/academic-centers/cyber-readiness-index">Cyber Readiness Index</a> or the <a href="https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/content/cmm-revised-edition">Cyber Security Capacity Maturity Model</a> could serve as starting points.</p>
<p>Implementing these recommendations will require political leadership in donor countries to ensure the cybersecurity and development communities talk to each other. Unfortunately, CCB efforts garner less attention than more high profile issues such as cyber espionage. The UN GGE gets a lot of attention in cyber policy circles and is expected to issue a report this summer. Having the GGE elevate the importance of connecting the security and development communities would go a long way in promoting the importance of cybersecurity capacity building.</p>

<p><span id="more-4876"></span></p>
<p>On March 14-16, the EastWest Institute (EWI), in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, hosted <a href="http://cybersummit.info/">a summit </a>featuring over 200 government officials, industry experts, academics, and activists from 30 countries. They met to identify areas of closer collaboration on attacks and sharing of threat information between corporations, governments, and other stakeholders that play a critical role in defending cyberspace.</p>
<p>Peter Altabef, president and CEO of Unisys, delivered a keynote focusing on Smart Cities, and the steps required to keep digital assets and communities safe, securing a balance between four factors: cybersecurity, personal safety, health, and infrastructure. Francis Fukuyama of Stanford University was featured in a discussion on trust in cybersecurity and explored the phenomenon of fake news, what he described as “today’s wild west of information sharing.”</p>
<p>Since 2009, EWI has brought together international actors through its Global Cyberspace Cooperation Summits, aiming to coordinate and consolidate progress, showcase results, and promote collective action. The summits provide a crucial forum for building international, private-public actions to foster international cooperation in cyberspace and norms of responsible behavior.</p>
<p>What makes the EWI summits unique is their emphasis on two areas: fostering robust debate that underscores the aspect of cooperation and finds common ground, and the impactful and results driven role of breakthrough groups, each of which focuses on a key aspect of the cybersecurity dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Moving the Needle: Breakthrough Groups</strong></p>
<p>This year’s groups are designed to advance solutions in five key specific areas: ubiquitous encryption and lawful government access; resilient cities and the internet of things; increasing the global availability and secure use of ICT products and services; systemic risk and cyber insurance; and promoting norms of responsible behavior in cyberspace. Importantly, each has a mandate to ensure progress is measurable, both quantitative and qualitative. One example is the introduction of the <a href="https://www.eastwest.ngo/idea/eastwest-institute-launches-cybersecurity-guide-technology-buyers">ICT Buyers Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Each breakthrough group affords debate, the exchange of salient information and advocates for recommendations that are practicable. Each includes the participation of senior level actors representing the private and public sectors so that perspectives and challenges are heard and acknowledged. The discussion was colored by the widely acknowledged sense that firms are increasingly on the front lines of cyberspace security, including defending against state-sponsored cyberattacks.</p>
<p>On the final day, Latha Reddy, former deputy national security advisor of India, chaired a panel on breakthrough group <a href="https://cybersummit.info/sites/cybersummit.info/files/breakthrough-group-reports.pdf">findings</a>. Each group presented conclusions and next programmatic steps and received comments from a distinguished expert panel.</p>
<p><strong>Valuing Contrasting Voices</strong></p>
<p>Over the three days, the aspect of varied opinions and experiences cannot be overstated. In fact, it defines the spirit and purpose of the event—defining and appreciating the obstacles and unique challenges that must be overcome to foster cooperation in cyberspace. Case in point: the keynote speech delivered by Katherine Getao, ICT Secretary at the Ministry of Information Communications and Technology of Kenya, provided a unique viewpoint from the Global South where there remains a distinct divide as to how developing nations fit in the context of the cybersecurity dialogue, and their continued relevance. To this end, Getao recommended that “all nations, regardless of geographic position or economic status, reduce adversarial positions and drive trust to help solve one another’s problems.”</p>
<p>Further cementing the multivariate aspect of cybersecurity, the summit introduced audiences to the <a href="https://cyberstability.org/">Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC)</a>. An initiative of the government of the Netherlands, the EastWest Institute, and The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, the GCSC is the first body of its kind—formed to develop proposals for norms and policies to enhance international cybersecurity and stability. Twenty-eight commissioners representing twelve countries will, over the next three years, work on developing proposals and advocating for their adoption globally.</p>
<p>Marina Kaljurand, former minister of foreign affairs of Estonia and GCSC chair, along with five commissioners, took the stage to convey to audiences the mission and vision of this body. The panel was met with numerous, thoughtful questions regarding its anticipated impact, its role with respect to existing multilateral discussions such as the United Nations group of governmental experts, and policy roadblocks such as the lack of an agreed definition of critical internet infrastructure. As a multistakeholder body, the Commission is uniquely positioned to develop consensus around the rules of the road in cyberspace.</p>
<p>The summit laid the foundation for ongoing cooperation in several areas. For example, we expect, in conjunction with the GCSC, to substantially increase international understanding and buy-in to specific norms of state and corporate behavior, to protect the safety and security of cyberspace as a global platform for governance, commerce, and public and private life in general. On the other hand, the encryption debate has proven to be difficult. EWI maintains the goal to develop recommendations for approaches that balance law enforcement&#8217;s needs with requirements for business confidentiality and individual data privacy by year&#8217;s end.</p>

<p><span id="more-4873"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. How can I turn this into a he said/Xi said headline?</strong> President Trump is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago club this weekend for their first face-to-face encounter, and cyber issues are <a href="https://twitter.com/adschina/status/849611920957210625">not expected to be discussed</a>. That&#8217;s in sharp contrast to the Obama&#8217;s administration&#8217;s approach which raised the issue with senior Chinese interlocutors at every opportunity as part of a campaign to stem the theft of U.S. intellectual property for commercial gain. There could be a number of explanations why cyber topics are unlikely to be discussed, but the smart money is on two theories. First, the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/fact-sheet-president-xi-jinpings-state-visit-united-states">deal</a> President Obama struck with Xi in September 2015 seems to be <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2016/09/28/the-u-s-china-cyber-espionage-deal-one-year-later/">holding</a>, making it potentially unnecessary to discuss Chinese cyber activity for now. Second, President Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-mar-a-lago-trump-to-welcome-chinas-xi-for-high-stakes-inaugural-summit/2017/04/06/0235cdd0-1ac2-11e7-bcc2-7d1a0973e7b2_story.html">has said he wants to focus</a> on the U.S. trade deficit with China and the North Korean nuclear program. Silence from the U.S. side does not mean that Xi&#8217;s team might not bring it up. Chinese officials I spoke to <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2017/01/23/the-continued-importance-of-the-u-s-china-cyber-dialogue/">earlier this year</a> expressed a continued desire to maintain high-level cyber talks. The likeliest cyber-related outcome of this weekend&#8217;s meeting is a commitment to maintaining the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/third-us-china-high-level-joint-dialogue-cybercrime-and-related-issues">high-level joint dialogue on cybercrime</a> and scheduling its next meeting.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mark your calendars: the lawful access debate gets solved in June.</strong> EU Justice Commissioner Věra Jourová announced that the European Commission <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/eu-to-propose-new-rules-on-police-access-to-encrypted-data-in-june/">will unveil a proposal</a> that would ensure EU governments have the ability to compel communication service providers to hand over user data to authorities. The United Kingdom, France and Germany&#8211;all of which have been victims of recent terrorist attacks and have found obtaining the chat logs of suspects troublesome&#8211;have put pressure on the Commission to find an EU-wide solution. For some app makers, retrieving user data is impossible even if compelled to do so because it is encrypted. And even if the requested data is not encrypted, retrieving it may be challenging given that the data may reside outside of the EU&#8217;s jurisdiction. Jourová said she expects to unveil a mix of legislative and voluntary measures in June.</p>
<p><strong>3. A delicate balancing act.</strong> Ministers responsible for digital issues in the G20 met in Dusseldorf, Germany for a two-day meeting and issued a declaration on &#8220;<a href="http://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/G/g20-digital-economy-ministerial-declaration-english-version.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=12">Shaping Digitalization for an Interconnected World</a>.&#8221; According to Germany, this was the first time that ministers with responsibilities over digital issues met as part of the G20 process. However, it was not the first time digital trade has been on the G20 agenda. Last year&#8217;s Hangzhou declaration mentioned <a href="http://www.g20chn.org/English/Dynamic/201609/t20160906_3396.html">digital economy issues</a> and the 2015 summit included a <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/11/16-g20-summit-antalya-communique/">prohibition</a> on the theft of intellectual property for commercial gain. This latest declaration includes carefully crafted language on the free flow of information (while respecting domestic and international law), the importance of a multistakeholder approach to policy development (but each stakeholder should stick it its own role and responsibilities), and that tech standards are consistent with WTO trade rules (although they can be overridden by &#8220;legitimate public policy goals.&#8221;)</p>
<p><strong>4. A textbook example of the Streisand Effect.</strong> The Trump administration is <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/850395470090448896">withdrawing</a> its request that Twitter hand over the user details the individual (or individuals) behind the <a href="https://twitter.com/alt_uscis?lang=en">@ALT_USCIS account</a>. Shortly after President Trump&#8217;s inauguration, a <a href="https://twitter.com/roguepotusstaff?lang=en">number</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ResistanceNASA">Twitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/altUSEPA">accounts </a>were created claiming to represent the views of Trump dissenters within the federal civil service, and @ALT_USCIS is believed to be run by employees of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service. Twitter <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39522164">announced it was challenging</a> the Trump&#8217;s administration demand to unmask those behind the account on free speech grounds, but later withdrew its suit after the Trump administration retracted its request. As is often the case on the internet, requesting that something be taken down often brings it more publicity&#8211;a phenomenon known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand effect</a>. In the twenty-four hours since the Trump administration&#8217;s request became public, @ALT_USCIS has <a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/850338178196271105">quadrupled</a> the numbers of its followers.</p>

Although my main argument is that government needs to create incentives for utility owners and operators to invest in cybersecurity, that investment should take place in part of a massive new investment to improve the grid’s resilience. It also needs to be redesigned to handle the shifting supply from renewable resources and be capable of moving electricity from where it is produced to where it is consumed.</p>
<p><span id="more-4812"></span></p>
<p>As I researched the report, I heard from multiple industry groups a variation of a theme that went like this: “The U.S. power grid supplies electricity that is reliable, cheap and increasingly green.” Yet, by international standards, none of the three are true.</p>
<p>The average American endures <a href="http://www.savivaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/April-2013-DERMS.pdf">upwards of six hours per year without electricity</a>. That puts the United States in the bottom category of the developed world with Portugal and Lithuania. Singapore, Germany, Japan and Denmark have close to zero down time. Urban Chinese experience less than half the downtime of an average American. It’s also a <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/aging-us-power-grid-blacks-out-more-any-other-developed-nation-1631086">285 percent increase</a> since 1982, when the Department of Energy began collecting the data.</p>
<p>While power may be available 99.5 percent of the time, the economic losses from these outages are estimated at $<a href="https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/DOE_SG_Book_Single_Pages%281%29.pdf#page=9">150 billion per year</a>. That figure puts it on par with the lower end of estimates for cybercrime. Yet while there are front page articles almost every day about cybercrime in its many forms, few people think much about the electricity that makes modern life possible until you cannot reheat a <a href="https://youtu.be/94dBs0qUiqU?t=7m31s">hot pocket in your microwave</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, despite this relatively poor level of reliability, U.S. electricity does not come cheap at an average of $0.18 per kilowatt hour. And, while there are signs that despite White House support for burning more coal, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishthachugh/2017/01/31/trump-cant-stop-renewables-energy-growth-at-home-or-abroad/#6a81214723a9">a renewable energy future is here to stay</a>. U.S. power remains some of the dirtiest in the world. In a <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sroc/Tables/t0305.pdf">study</a> of 34 countries developed countries, the United States came in 26<sup>th</sup> for the dirtiest power.</p>
<p>While less than a month ago, President Trump <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/28/trump-congress-address-infrastructure-investment/">called</a> for spending $1 trillion on improving America’s infrastructure, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/2018_blueprint.pdf">budget</a> released by the White House makes no mention of the commitment. It in fact would cut 5.6 percent from the Department of Energy while increasing spending within the Department on nuclear weapons programs.</p>
<p>President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/28/remarks-president-trump-joint-address-congress">pledged</a> to replace “crumbling infrastructure” with “new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.” While these are no doubt worthwhile efforts, if the President’s goal is to spur economic growth, improving the resilience of the power grid so it can handle weather events and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/whos-winning-the-cyber-war-the-squirrels-of-course/">squirrels</a>, as well as cyberattacks, should be the top priority. The digital economy, growing at 7 percent per year (as opposed to 2 percent for the rest of the economy) disappears when the power goes away.</p>
<p>For now, that has only happened in the United States due to weather events, high demand, and those pesky squirrels (or a combination of all three). In the future, longer and more sustained blackouts and associated economic harm may be caused by malicious actors through cyberattacks.</p>
<p>The United States cannot be great again unless the infrastructure that supports its economy is also great. Right now, the United States is not a leader when it comes to the reliability, cost, or environmental impact of its aging power system.</p>
<p>The Trump administration should work with Congress and the private owners and operators of the grid to put in place a plan to modernize the grid. In doing so, they should ensure that updated systems improve security and create a defensible architecture so that attacks on the grid can be detected, that information shared across the industry, and malicious actors held accountable. That would truly be great.</p>

<p>As the next billion people move online, governments worldwide are adopting legislation that curtails free expression rights on the internet. Pushing back against this trend is important to safeguard one of the most fundamental freedoms. If done right, it can even promote the internet’s original purpose as a “<a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">universal space</a>” of information where information can be exchanged freely, strengthening democracies around the world.</p>
<p>A number of recently adopted laws purportedly aim to combat criminal activity online, which may be perceived as a noble cause. They often follow closely the model of the <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention">Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime</a> (also called the Budapest Convention), or its African counterpart the <a href="https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/AU-270614-CSConvention.pdf">African Union Convention on Cyberspace Security and Protection of Personal Data</a>. Amongst the countries currently considering &#8220;cybercrime&#8221; laws are <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/government/194950-south-africas-new-cybercrimes-bill-to-be-tabled-in-parliament.html">South Africa</a>, <a href="http://www.techzim.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Zimbabwes-Draft-Computer-Crime-and-Cybercrime-Bill-Laymans-Draft-July-2013.pdf">Zimbabwe</a>, <a href="http://www.ttparliament.org/publications.php?mid=28&amp;id=723">Trinidad and Tobago</a> and <a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/04/13/a-breakdown-of-the-current-version-of-brazils-cybercrimes-bill/">Brazil</a>. Other countries, such as <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/10/29/tanzania_s_terrible_cybercrimes_act_used_to_arrest_opposition_leaders.html">Tanzania</a>, <a href="https://cert.gov.ng/images/uploads/CyberCrime_(Prohibition,Prevention,etc)_Act,_2015.pdf">Nigeria</a>, <a href="http://www.cyberlawhub.com/it-act-2000-with-2008-amendment.php">India</a> and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/pakistan-national-assembly-passes-new-cybercrime-law/">Pakistan</a>, have already adopted such laws. All these laws contain provisions that bear a striking resemblance to each other, and their overbroad and vague nature inevitably criminalize and jeopardize a wide range of internet activity. The copy-paste approach adopted by many countries has resulted in these stifling laws spreading across the globe at a concerning rate.</p>
<p>The recent cybercrime laws and bills have two main issues in common. First, they create an array of speech crimes and, second, they lack protection for journalistic sources and those publishing anonymously in the public interest. While rumors about the Trinidadian bill including <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/T-T-gov-t-tackles--fake--news-on-social-media">anti-&#8220;fake news&#8221; provisions</a> have turned out to be incorrect, the bill still contains provisions that could severely impact media freedom, such as penalizing reports on corporate corruption. Its application could also result in the criminal prosecution of bloggers and other internet users for the smallest of infractions, such as violating a website&#8217;s terms of service. The impact of overbroad laws targeting speech online has been seen in Nigeria and India. The Nigerian Cybercrimes Act has been used to <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2016/09/22/how-nigerias-cybercrime-law-being-used-try-muzzle-press/">prosecute individuals who alleged that public officials had been having extramarital affairs</a>. In India, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-32029369">a girl was arrested for merely “liking” a post on Facebook</a>. All examples that show the level of suppression of speech these laws allow for.</p>
<p>Clamping down on online speech is not a new phenomenon; cybercrime legislation is the latest incarnation of a longer-existing trend. <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/azerbaijan">Azerbaijan extended its defamation laws to the internet in 2013</a>, to which it added specific provisions <a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-criminalizes-defamation-of-president-online/3617948.html">making defamation of the President online a criminal offence</a>. Publishing on the internet usually is an aggravating factor for other criminal offences, such as defamation, as is <a href="http://www.altalex.com/documents/news/2002/05/16/la-diffamazione-on-line">demonstrated by legislation in Italy</a>.</p>
<p>Cybercrime legislation also generally comes with wide powers of search, seizure and disclosure which can threaten whistleblowers, journalistic sources and anonymity online. Nigeria&#8217;s Cybercrimes Act, for example, provides that an internet service provider must retain and release user data (including content data) at the request of the <a href="http://www.ncc.gov.ng/">Nigerian Communications Commission</a>. The Tanzania Cybercrimes Act gives the police the authority to request user data for the purpose of carrying out an investigation. In 2016, Maxence Melo, founder and owner of the Tanzanian <a href="https://www.jamiiforums.com/">online news platform Jamii Forums</a> – which has the tagline &#8220;The Home of Great Thinkers. Where we Dare to Talk Openly!&#8221; – was <a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/maxence-m-melo-arrested-and-detained">arrested after refusing to hand over to the authorities information that could be used to identify anonymous website contributors</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> guarantees the right to &#8220;seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers&#8221;, as does the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and the main regional human rights treaties. As the next millions of people move online over the coming years, especially in Africa and Asia where these laws have become prevalent, it is crucial that this right is protected to safeguard the free flow of information online.</p>
<p>Practice shows that pushing back on restrictions to online expression is worthwhile. An option that has had some success is challenging these laws in court. The <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/FileServer/2015-03-24_1427183283.pdf">Indian Supreme Court</a> in 2015 scrapped a provision criminalizing “offensive messages” online, under which a girl was criminally prosecuted for a Facebook &#8220;like&#8221;. The Supreme Court found that the provision unnecessarily curbed the right to freedom of expression. A similar provision was also <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/38343/en/kenya:-win-for-freedom-of-expression-as-repressive-law-declared-unconstitutional">struck down in Kenya on the same ground</a>. Another avenue is to lobby for change before these laws are passed. <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Mexican-Lawmaker-Offers-to-Burn-Cybercrime-Bill-After-Backlash-20151102-0027.html">Mexico scrapped its Cybercrime Bill</a> after severe criticism from internet users and activist groups, including Anonymous, which triggered a public backlash. <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2017/03/07/south-africa-introduces-revised-cybercrime-legislation-acknowledging-criticism/">South Africa improved its bill drastically</a> after civil society campaigned relentlessly.</p>
<p>What is not an option, is not fighting back. Not when the right to freely use one of the most crucial information and communication platforms of our time is at stake.</p>

<p><span id="more-4854"></span></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/did-china-quietly-authorize-law-enforcement-access-data-anywhere-world">an article</a> published on <em>Lawfare</em> earlier this week, Susan Hennessey and Christopher Mirasola analyze a set of Chinese government rules regarding the collection and use of electronic data during criminal investigations by China’s law enforcement authorities. Released in September 2016, <a href="http://www.spp.gov.cn/xwfbh/wsfbt/201609/t20160920_167380_1.shtml">the regulations</a> authorize the Ministry of Public Security, which oversees law enforcement, public safety, and domestic counterintelligence, to, “through the Internet, extract electronic data originating from storage media located overseas or remote computer information systems” in the course of criminal investigations.</p>
<p>In their article, Hennessey and Mirasola call this part of the rules “a potentially rather alarming development [that seems] to authorize the unilateral extraction of data concerning anyone (or any company) being investigated under Chinese criminal law from servers and hard drives located outside of China.” According to Hennessey and Mirasola, this represents “a dramatic departure from the U.S. view that the ordinary prohibitions on law enforcement operating in a foreign territory without permission apply to the remote search of electronic evidence.” They note, however, that “these regulations do not depart from China’s understanding of cyber sovereignty.”</p>
<p>This assessment of these Chinese regulations both overstates their significance and obscures the similarity between the Chinese government’s approach to law enforcement authorities’ access to data located beyond their jurisdiction and the practice of the U.S. government on this issue.</p>
<p>Chinese law often has as much to do with <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4NL-YwQNTKMC">codifying existing government practice</a> as it does with authorizing and prescribing new government action. In this case, it is hard to believe that the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) has spent the last twenty years completely avoiding accessing electronic data because there were not clear regulations from the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate about how that data should be accessed and handled. Instead, these regulations were likely drawn up in accordance with standard MPS practice, formalizing an existing approach to accessing electronic data in criminal investigations.</p>
<p>Nor does the authority outlined in the September 2016 regulations differ in spirit from the approach that U.S. law enforcement agencies have adopted in recent years. When U.S. criminal investigators discover that there may be evidence related to a crime stored on a computer system physically located outside the United States, they have two options for accessing it.</p>
<p>Their first option is to request that the relevant law enforcement authority in the country where the electronic data is physically located access the data and share it with them. This is a convoluted and time-consuming process; as a result, it is unpopular among many law enforcement officers, and some have argued that it is insufficient for criminal investigations that are time sensitive.</p>
<p>The second option available to investigators depends on who has control and ownership of the data in the foreign country. If the data is stored on a computer system owned and operated by a subsidiary of a U.S. corporation, law enforcement officers can request that a judge issue a warrant requiring that the corporation hand over the data. This is the subject of an <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/24/us_government_microsoft_email_seizure_appeal/">ongoing dispute</a> between the Department of Justice (DoJ) and Microsoft, regarding a court order demanding that Microsoft turn over data related to one of its customers that is physically stored on a server located in Ireland. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the government does not have the authority to compel the disclosure of electronic data stored overseas to the government. Nevertheless, just last month, the <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/04/google_must_provide_emails_held_overseas/">DoJ sought and obtained</a> an order to compel Google hand over data held overseas, which Google is contesting.</p>
<p>This view of the importance and justice of government access to overseas electronic data for criminal investigations is the same as that espoused in the September 2016 Chinese regulations. Both governments believe it is their right to access this data. Fortunately for the U.S. government, it has jurisdiction over the vast majority of the world’s largest online service providers, and so it sees compelling them to hand over data as the most expedient route for solving crimes.</p>
<p>The Chinese government, on the other hand, does not have this option, and so it must take recourse to the next best thing: accessing computer systems directly. Whether the U.S. government compels a company to hand over data or the Chinese authorities simply take it, the intent and effect are the same.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the U.S. legal process—law enforcement seeking a warrant from a judge appointed by an elected official, the company targeted by the warrant having the opportunity to contest it in court, and so on—is equivalent to the Chinese legal process. The U.S. legal system is orders of magnitude more transparent, open, and accountable than the Chinese system. However, despite a legitimate legal process, the U.S. government compels companies to hand over data because it can, and in cases where it can&#8217;t, the U.S. government is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/new-us-law-making-it-easier-to-search-computers-takes-effect-thursday/">happy to resort to hacking</a> into a remote computer system to access data, albeit with a court order.</p>
<p>Both governments seem to hold that they have sovereignty over data stored beyond their borders when it comes to criminal investigations. And that’s a position all of us—citizens of China and citizens of the United States—should find alarming.</p>

<p>With technology empowering non-traditional actors who create asymmetric threats, there are real questions as to how the Department of Defense (DOD) can best ensure security and preserve privacy. For many years, DOD has worked to attract top technologists from Silicon Valley. I was part of one White House initiative called the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a>, where technologists and venture capitalists go to Washington for six- to twelve-month tours of duty, working with chief technology officers at various agencies.</p>
<p>But in 2015, then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter flipped the model on its head and moved part of the defense community out of Northern Virginia, three thousand miles west to Silicon Valley. He helped create the <a href="https://www.diux.mil/">Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx)</a>.</p>
<p>In Silicon Valley, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has for many years talked about how “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is eating the world</a>.” He argues that technology has come to affect every corner of our world. In moving elements of DOD west and embracing the technology community in its own environment, DIUx has been a catalyst in bringing some of the most profound, intractable problems to a valley full of people looking to chase big ideas.</p>
<p>One of the most promising results of this westward push has been the establishment of a class called <a href="http://hacking4defense.stanford.edu/">Hacking 4 Defense (H4D)</a> at Stanford University, brought to life by two U.S. Army Colonels, <a href="http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/joseph_felter">Joe Felter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petenewell/">Pete Newell</a>. Felter and Newell help translate the experiences and needs of the defense community to Silicon Valley. Having also recruited professor and serial entrepreneur <a href="https://steveblank.com/">Steve Blank</a> to develop the H4D course, today the trio helps teach an entrepreneurship course aimed at solving some of the biggest problems from DOD.</p>
<p>In H4D classes, active military units and intelligence officers submit problems they face to students, who then launch minimum viable products and work with them to refine the product—an approach known as “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1489779722&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lean+startup&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=hartglob0c-20&amp;linkId=9c0102f371724bfbfc286cb335deb183">lean startup</a>.” As part of this process, students must develop an authentic understanding of the challenges military and intelligence personnel face. Students visit training camps, wear scuba diving dry suits to understand needs of Navy SEALs, and learn about the requirements of ordnance disposal unit’s bomb suit needs on base with the Air Force. The class is open to students from all backgrounds and departments, and features political scientists and engineers working side by side.</p>
<p>H4D helps bring together what at Stanford are known as “fuzzies” and “techies,” namely those who study the arts, humanities, and social sciences, and those who study the computer sciences or engineering respectively. The pairing creates a deeply collaborative environment that brings together the context around the problems to be solved and the code to solve it.</p>
<p>One challenge, posted by the U.S. Army Cyber Command, was to “determine how to use emerging data mining, machine learning, and data science capabilities to understand, disrupt, and counter our adversaries’ use of social media.” The description highlighted that “current tools do not provide users with a way to understand the meaning within adversary social media content . . . Current tools and methods monitor social media streams and can provide quantitative measures (volume, relevance, search). These tools fall short by failing to capture the content from the sites where most of the actual meaning is transmitted.” In other words, the U.S. Army Cyber Command sought a hybrid solution to a problem, one-part human, one-part technical, just like the composition of the class. In a world of compartmentalized expertise, the Army recognized the value of a solution that was not technology-only, but rather required both social science and engineering. The solution had to effectively degrade adversarial social media use, but do so within the guidelines of U.S. law and policy.</p>
<p>In 2016, Blank and Felter also helped create “<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/msande298/">Hacking 4 Diplomacy</a>,” a course aimed at building technology solutions for the State Department. The class offers students opportunities, for example, to work on building tools to combat violent extremists such as the self-declared Islamic State group. Solutions will again likely combine the power of machine-learning algorithms with data pulled from a number of online sources, and with the fuzzy understanding of the culture and psychology of adversaries.</p>
<p>For understandable reasons, these courses have garnered attention. In the fall of 2016 Stanford hosted 75 attendees in an educator’s class focused on training the trainer. This year, 13 other colleges such as Georgia Tech, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Southern California, and Georgetown will begin teaching their own H4D courses, with additional problem sets provided by the diplomatic, defense, and intelligence communities.</p>
<p>Rather than lionize technology as a standalone solution, policymakers ought to recognize the value of context that can be provided by our men and women in uniform, and pair their understanding of the toughest national security challenges we face, with some of the nation’s brightest minds in technology. This pairing of experts across domains yields results.</p>

<p><span id="more-4827"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. One Windows to rule them all? Nope. </strong><em>The</em><em> Wall Street Journal </em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-modifies-windows-10-for-chinas-government-1490097182">reports</a> that Microsoft finished development of a tailor-made version of Windows 10 for Chinese government use. The modifications come in response to China’s desire for <a href="http://supchina.com/2017/03/16/china-eight-guardian-warriors-tech/">“secure and controllable” technology</a> that cannot be utilized by foreign governments, most notably the United States, for surveillance purposes. China dropped many of Microsoft’s products from government procurement lists after the Snowden revelations, fearing that U.S. software was riddled with backdoors planted by the National Security Agency. Company representatives have not disclosed what was modified to meet Chinese standards. Microsoft, along with other tech companies that will likely follow suit in contouring products to Chinese government specifications, will have to straddle the line between safeguarding intellectual property and revealing just enough about their source code to reassure Chinese officials that their software won’t leave cadres vulnerable to Uncle Sam’s prying eyes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Well, maybe not an <em>entirely</em> clean reauthorization…</strong> Republican lawmakers <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-surveillance-idUSKBN16R2O1">might be reevaluating</a> their stance on section 702 of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the section that authorizes controversial surveillance programs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_collection">Upstream</a> and permits the &#8220;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-republican-hypocrisy-on-surveillance-leaks-and-snowden">incidental collection</a>&#8221; of data on U.S. persons when U.S. intelligence agencies target the communications of foreign nationals. Section 702 is scheduled to <a href="https://icontherecord.tumblr.com/topics/section-702">sunset later this year</a>, setting up a fight over its reauthorization. Earlier this year, Congressional Republicans had begun advocating for a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fisa-idUSKBN16855P">&#8220;clean&#8221; reauthorization</a>, but some may have changed their given recent allegations of contact between the Trump transition team and Russian officials. This week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/politics/devin-nunes-wiretapping-trump.html">claimed</a> that members of President Trump&#8217;s transition team had their communications monitored through incidental collection. Similarly, Michael Flynn, President Trump&#8217;s former national security advisor, was forced to resign when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html">his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak</a> were incidentally collected. Both of these incidents have led at least one member of Congress, Trey Gowdy (R-SC), to <a href="http://www.defenseone.com/politics/2017/03/gop-lawmaker-fbi-stop-leaks-russia-probe-or-lose-key-surveillance-tool/136325/">hint</a> that further leaks of incidental collection on team Trump might put section 702 in jeopardy.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can the court compel decryption? </strong>A U.S. man refusing to comply with an order to decrypt hard drives seized by police has <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/153537p.pdf">lost his case</a> before the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Police believe the hard drives contain images of child sexual abuse and obtained court order requiring the man to provide them with the password to decrypt the drives. The man refused, invoking his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, and has been detained for the last <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/man-jailed-indefinitely-for-refusing-to-decrypt-hard-drives-loses-appeal/">18 months</a>. The man, who has not been criminally charged, is likely to remain in custody indefinitely unless his defense team decides to appeal the Circuit Court decision and wins or complies with the order.</p>

<p><span id="more-4829"></span></p>
<p>Trade, and its phenomenal expansion in the last two decades, has been decisive for lifting more than one billion people out of poverty. Yet, judging from the current debate on global trade, this basic fact seems to have been forgotten. Even some Western democracies, traditionally the biggest proponent of trade, seem increasingly lukewarm—in a few cases, reluctant—to keeping their borders open to goods and services.</p>
<p>Trade skeptics argue the benefits of trade have not been equitable. They have a point. Though some consumers have benefited, large companies have gained the most from global integration, and account for the vast majority of world trade. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), women and rural communities have often been less fortunate.</p>
<p>However, the imbalance is not due to excessive globalization. On the contrary, those on the margins have not been able to benefit because they lack the capacity to fully participate in global trade.</p>
<p>The internet and digital technologies are game-changers.</p>
<p>Digital trade, or e-commerce as it is usually called, is growing rapidly. Estimates show that in 2015 it amounted to a staggering <a href="http://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=1281">$22 trillion</a>. Rich nations are leading the way, but others are not far behind. In China, over <a href="http://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=1281">400 million people</a> participate in e-commerce—ten times more than in Germany. The value of all goods traded on China&#8217;s Alibaba has, in the <a href="https://revenuesandprofits.com/alibaba-gmv-crosses-half-trillion-dollars/">last four quarters</a> alone, been equivalent to the GDP of my home country <a href="https://data.oecd.org/sweden.htm">Sweden</a>.</p>
<p>Far more companies, especially SMEs, have also become exporters through internet-based trade, almost accidentally. <a href="https://www.ebaymainstreet.com/sites/default/files/2015-us-small-biz-global-growth-report.pdf">According to eBay</a>, some 95 percent of the U.S.-based SMEs that sell their products on eBay&#8217;s platforms have ended up exporting their merchandise. Of these, the majority of SMEs exported their products to four or more continents. These companies have also faster growth and survival rate than the national average, even higher than for traditional exporting enterprises.</p>
<p>The lack of borders on the internet makes it easier to overcome the many borders and other hurdles that still apply to physical trade. And this is true for trade between countries, and equally true for trade within countries, which matters a lot. Increased productivity and employment opportunities in rural areas though domestic trade creates more equitable societies, reduces unsustainable pressures for urbanization, and combats poverty. The former pig-farming village of Dong Feng in China <a href="http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ier2015_en.pdf,">is an excellent example</a>. In 2006, a young village entrepreneur established an online store to sell furniture, inspired by Ikea. Within four years, furniture production had boomed and, with it, cotton refinement as well as three hardware stores, fifteen logistics and distribution companies and seven computer stores. Today, the village and its surroundings host no less than 400 online stores that sell merchandise within China and abroad, to a value of $50 million annually.</p>
<p>What is more, e-commerce is already leaving its mark on global trade. Since the 2007 financial crisis, world trade has struggled to recover. In fact, if trade continues on its current trajectory for the next few years, this decade will have had the slowest pace of trade growth measured since World War II. There are, however, a few exceptions to this generally bleak picture. Business to consumer e-commerce is growing at <a href="https://www.ecommerce-europe.eu/news-item/double-digit-growth-global-b2c-e-commerce-sales-2015/">double-digit rates</a> and show no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Thanks to internet-related trade, there is an enormous opportunity to make tomorrow&#8217;s trade more inclusive and to break the current pattern of slow overall trade growth.</p>
<p>But there is much to do to fully tap this potential. The gaps between rich and poor citizens, communities and countries are still large when it comes to readiness for e-commerce. Whereas 70 percent of consumers in United Kingdom have bought things online, only <a href="http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ier2015_en.pdf,">5 percent</a> of consumers have done so in a number of emerging economies. And it is even less among consumers in the poorest countries.</p>
<p>Countries should take a number of actions to build a business environment that better utilizes the internet and mobile communications, especially in rural communities and poorer countries. They should, among other things, adopt policies that foster competitive ICT-infrastructure, efficient payments solutions, modern customs, and adequate legislation on consumer protection and data.</p>
<p>It is doable. And the good news is, when the right conditions are in place, leapfrogging is possible. M-Pesa, the mobile-based money transfer system, has succeeded to revolutionize financial inclusion, especially in Kenya. Digital solutions can bring significant benefits to far more people and far more cost-efficiently than in past. And the benefits are not limited to ICT-services, or even services at large, but also play a critical role for the future of manufacturing and agriculture.</p>
<p>Global e-commerce is in its infancy, but it is already altering how countries trade with each other. It is making traditional hurdles such as geography, size and capital-endowments far less relevant for a country’s successful integration into world economy. It offers both new growth prospects and more inclusivity from trade. Putting serious efforts in unleashing its full potential is a no-brainer.</p>

<p><span id="more-4809"></span></p>
<p>Following the hacking of the U.S. Democratic National Committee and the revelations that Russian-affiliated groups seem to have conducted online influence operations in the lead up to the 2016 U.S. election, multiple <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage">commentators</a> have <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/trump-putin-and-the-new-cold-war">speculated</a> that large numbers of Russian social media bots were backing Trump in the lead up to his “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/19/unpresidented-trump-word-definition">unpresidented</a>” victory. Similar concerns have been expressed about the forthcoming German and French <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2017/0109/Germany-s-plan-to-fight-fake-news">elections</a>, with experts and even government agencies issuing <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/08/french-intelligence-agency-braces-for-russian-bots-to-back-le-pen/">warnings</a> about the impending possibility of Russian influence exerted online via bots and other techniques.</p>
<p>Political bots are part of a nebulous and nefarious digital media ecosystem that our team at the University of Oxford is calling computational propaganda, a term which covers automated systems that spread disinformation, certain types of trolling, and various data-driven efforts to shape public opinion online. These bots—social media identities that use automated scripts to rapidly or strategically disseminate content—are rapidly becoming an important element of online politics, and seem to blur the lines between political marketing, algorithmic manipulation, and propaganda.</p>
<p>However, our current ability to accurately trace bot activity back to those controlling and deploying them is limited. Although it is possible—and perhaps even probable—that there has been Russian-linked bot activity on major social media platforms in the lead up to the U.S. election (and that this could occur again in the lead up to the various elections happening in Europe this year), it is important to keep in mind the following caveats, many of which apply not just to bots, but also other forms of computational propaganda.</p>
<p>Detecting bots is hard. The social media platforms on which these bots operate are not transparent (especially Facebook), making it difficult to get concrete data on bot activity. The techniques generally used by researchers to sniff out bots on Twitter, such as frequency and network analyses, are slowly improving, yet lag behind the increasingly sophisticated bots they are supposed to detect.</p>
<p>Another core problem is of attribution: when we do uncover large networks of bots, internet protocol address masking services make it very easy for the users to obfuscate where the content is really coming from and who is actually behind it. In my own fieldwork in Poland, it has become apparent that many of these bots feature hybrid levels of automation, maintaining enough human involvement as to make them virtually indistinguishable from a real user on a platform like Facebook. While we can use manual heuristics to infer certain details, this is far from a perfect approach to verifying bot origin.</p>
<p>Of course, these challenges are exactly what could make political bots attractive for state or non-state actors, who will almost certainly be able to maintain plausible deniability by operating through proxies and taking simple steps to cover their tracks. Bots are an easy to implement, low-cost and low-risk approach. There is little that overtly distinguishes a Russian pro-Trump bot from an American pro-Trump bot.</p>
<p>We do not yet fully understand the effects that bots can have on individual and group behavior, especially in political contexts. Bots can provide subtle nudges to the indices which users may assume are trustworthy: metrics such as likes, retweets, shares, or views, can easily and invisibly be gamed. How does this affect the end user? Our team’s recent research is only now beginning to get insights into the ways that these bots can affect the dissemination of hyper-partisan or misleading information. It is likely that the effects of computational propaganda need to be understood not in the traditional sense as explicitly causing changes in voter behavior, but rather in a more nuanced sense as having shifted trends, affected media coverage, and subtly shaped the political discourse.</p>
<p>Finally, the impact of these developments will likely vary in differing socio-political contexts, with various legal, policy, and media environments rendering certain populations more or less vulnerable to information manipulation than others. For this reason, our team is currently conducting a cross-national study of computational propaganda in ten different countries, slated for release in a series of working papers this summer.</p>
<p>Recent Russian influence operations are a worrying development, but it is important that efforts to investigate them acknowledge the considerable limitations of our current understanding. In that sense, the possible existence of malicious Russian bots is just as concerning as how little we actually know about them.</p>

<p><strong>1. The plot thickens in U.S.-Russia cyber espionage.</strong> On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions">indicted</a> four men, including two Russian intelligence officials working for the FSB, for the <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2017/03/15/hacking-charges-against-russian-fsb-officers-a-quick-reaction/">breach of over 500 million Yahoo accounts</a>. The DOJ indictment <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/russia-spies-yahoo-hacking-justice-department-236082">marks the first time</a> the United States has charged Russian government officials with cyber crime-related charges. One of the officials, Dmitry Dokuchaev is emerging as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/world/europe/russian-hacker-fsb-agent-dmitry-dokuchaev.html">a particularly interesting figure</a> given that he was also charged with treason in Russia earlier this year. According to the indictment, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/15/fsb_agentsindicted_yahoo_megahack/">6,500 Yahoo accounts</a> belonging to both U.S. and Russian targets were mined for information potentially useful to FSB intelligence targets. The defendants <a href="https://lawfareblog.com/government-indicts-fsb-officers-and-two-others-yahoo-hacking-case">have been charged</a> with a laundry list of conspiratorial cybercrimes, including thefts of identities and trade secrets, and economic espionage. I give my two cents on the case <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2017/03/15/hacking-charges-against-russian-fsb-officers-a-quick-reaction/">here</a>, Charley Snyder and Michael Sulmeyer over at <em>Lawfare</em> do the same <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/department-justice-makes-next-move-us-russia-espionage-drama">here</a>, and Marcy Wheeler argues that this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/03/15/the-yahoo-indictment-erectile-dysfunction-marketing-plus-stuff-nsa-does-all-the-time/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is this what Russia meant by public diplomacy? </strong>The Russian embassy in the United Kingdom is turning its Twitter followers into automated bots to generate a positive social media presence for the Russian ambassador. According to <em>Motherboard</em>, this “<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-russian-embassy-is-asking-people-to-become-twitter-bots">diplomacy of the future</a>” scheme entails that users voluntarily register their Twitter credentials with a third-party app that then automatically follows ambassador Alexander Yakovenko and retweets “important” tweets from his week. The Russian embassy is pitching the program as a way for those interested in international affairs to get information from top Russian diplomats. Unsurprisingly, some are skeptical and view it as a way to Russia to boost the numbers of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/16/twitter-users-volunteer-to-be-russias-latest-weapon-in-the-information-wars">its troll and bot army</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Google and Facebook get a grilling in Europe. </strong>Germany has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/14/germany_proposes_50m_fake_news_fine/">formally proposed</a> fining Facebook and Twitter to the tune of $53 million if both do not toughen up on fake news and hate speech. German interior minister Heiko Maas introduced legislation on Tuesday that would require social media networks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/technology/germany-hate-speech-facebook-tech.html">delete illegal posts</a> from their platforms within twenty-four hours, as well as publish quarterly reports outlining how they have been policing content. The tech firms <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39272261?ocid=socialflow_twitter">maintained their commitment</a> to protecting freedom of expression, stoking the <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/germany-treads-thin-line-between-hate-speech-and-free-expression/a-19199024">already rigorous debate</a> in Germany regarding the implications of censorship on the right to free speech. Earlier this year, Facebook introduced a tool allowing German users to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38631847">flag fake news stories for removal.</a> That move has apparently not persuaded German officials, who seem to believe that a legislative approach will solve the problem of online trolls and misinformation.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Privacy Shield is safe for now. </strong>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-dataprotection-usa-idUSKBN16H2KH">indicated</a> this week that the Privacy Shield, one of many arrangements that allow the transfer of EU citizens&#8217; data across the Atlantic, will remain intact under the Donald J. Trump administration. President Trump&#8217;s unpopularity in Europe and his executive order on immigration that banned Privacy Act protections to non-U.S. citizens led <a href="http://www.hldataprotection.com/2017/01/articles/international-eu-privacy/trumps-executive-order-does-not-impact-u-s-privacy-shield-commitments/">some in Europe to believe</a> that the shield would be torn asunder. At the end of a meeting with Ross, the European Commission&#8217;s lead on the Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said that they both supported a “<a href="https://twitter.com/Ansip_EU/status/839911087944396800">robust and predictable</a>” Privacy Shield.</p>
<p><strong>5. NSA official Rob Joyce tapped as White House cybersecurity coordinator. </strong>The Trump administration <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/15/rob-joyce-nsa-hacker-tapped-national-security-coun/">has picked</a> Rob Joyce to serve as the next cybersecurity coordinator for the National Security Council. Joyce has worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) for more than twenty-five years, and has served since 2013 as chief of Tailored Access Operations, the NSA’s elite hacking division.</p>

<p><span id="more-4788"></span></p>
<p>This morning, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-fsb-officers-and-their-criminal-conspirators-hacking-yahoo-and-millions">announced</a> the indictment of four people allegedly responsible for the breach of over 500 million Yahoo accounts the <a href="https://about.yahoo.com/press-release?key=important-message-yahoo-users-security-182800027&amp;region=US&amp;lang=en-US&amp;soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma">company announced last year</a>. What makes this interesting is that two of the indictees are Russian intelligence officials working for the FSB&#8211;the successor to the KGB.</p>
<p>It looks like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) nabbed a pretty classic espionage operation. According to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/948201/download">indictment</a>, two FSB officers&#8211;Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin&#8211;and Alexsey Belan&#8211;one of the FBI&#8217;s most wanted criminals and named in the sanctions President Obama issued against Russia in response to the DNC hack&#8211;obtained access to Yahoo&#8217;s user database. They then used that access to access the accounts of possible Russian intelligence targets, such as diplomats, investigative reporters, and representatives of U.S. companies. Dokuchaev and Sushchin also used the data to help Karim Baratov access approximately 80 accounts hosted by Google and an unnamed Russian provider. Baratov, a 22-year-old dual Kazakh-Canadian citizen living outside of Toronto, was paid for his services and <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/yahoo-hack-karim-baratov-taloverov-canadian-ancaster-kazakhstan-1.4026162">liked nice cars</a>.</p>
<p>The indictment also alleges that Dokuchaev and Sushchin helped Belan mine the Yahoo data for his personal criminal purposes, who searched compromised accounts for credit card details and gift cards either to use for himself or to sell in cybercrime forums.</p>
<p>There are a couple of significant differences between this incident and the other instances in which the U.S. government laid hacking charges on state-sponsored actors. In the 2014 indictment of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor">five People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) officers</a>, it was clear that China was not going to turn them over. In that case, the charges were probably more political&#8211;forcing China to reckon with seriousness with which the United States took the pilfering of its companies&#8217; intellectual property. The 2016 charges against the Iranians affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards were probably less political, but nevertheless were partly meant to discourage Iranians from hacking U.S. targets <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2015/04/01/sanctioning-hackers/">lest it hinder their ability to travel</a> and as a deterrent to future hacking, a sign that the United States could attribute attacks to individuals.</p>
<p>In this recent case, at least one of the indictees&#8211;Karim Baratov&#8211;is likely to see the inside of a U.S. court. Canadian authorities arrested him yesterday and he is likely to be extradited. There are a number of instances in the indictment that suggest U.S. authorities obtained evidence of the links between Baratov and the FSB by monitoring their communications. During a criminal trial, that would possibly require U.S. prosecutors to disclose how they monitored the conversations and under what authorities. In a recent case against alleged child pornographers, the DOJ <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/feds-rather-drop-child-porn-case-give-exploit/">chose to drop its charges</a> instead of revealing how investigators exploited a vulnerability in the TOR network to identify the suspects. That could also happen here if Baratov contests the accusations. The DOJ could put pressure on Baratov to plead guilty to lesser charges to avoid that outcome. It is worth noting that in a previous hacking case, Su Bin, a Chinese national living in Canada, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/vancouver-businessman-gets-jail-sentence-for-stealing-us-military-data/article30932488/">pled guilty</a> to stealing information from U.S. defense contractors for the PLA&#8217;s consumption, making it unnecessary for the federal government to prove its case.</p>
<p>Another oddity with the case is the fact that Dmitry Dokuchaev was arrested earlier this year in Russia and accused with treason, along with the former head of the FSB&#8217;s information security center, <a href="https://themoscowtimes.com/news/second-fsb-agent-arrested-for-treason-revealed-as-notorious-hacker-56955">Sergei Mikhailov and a former Kaspersky employee</a>. It is unclear what Dokuchaev might have done that was treasonous in the eyes of the Russian legal system. One theory is that <a href="https://themoscowtimes.com/news/second-fsb-agent-arrested-for-treason-revealed-as-notorious-hacker-56955">he was a CIA mole</a>, which begs the question why would the U.S. file charges against one of its assets? Another could be that he hacked the wrong people while making a bit of money on the side, and got swept up for that.</p>
<p>The ripple effects will be felt on two fronts. First, these indictments obviously worsen and complicate the relationship with Russia in cyberspace. Some saw the Shadow Brokers leaks of NSA hacking tools in August 2016 as retribution for the attribution of the DNC hacks to Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear and as a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/snowden-speculates-leak-of-nsa-spying-tools-is-tied-to-russian-dnc-hack/">warning shot across the bow</a>, a reminder that Russia is a very capable actor in cyberspace. We will have to wait how the Kremlin decides to respond this time, but it is likely to be a mix of official and asymmetric actions.</p>
<p>Second, in announcing the indictments, the DOJ trumpeted the cooperation with Yahoo and other tech companies, and <a href="https://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/158438180334/russian-hackers-and-government-officers-indicted">Yahoo did the same</a>. For DOJ and FBI, this is a welcome change of messaging to Silicon Valley. The headline is not that law enforcement wants to weaken encryption and build backdoors in products, but that working closely with the government can result in taking down state-backed hackers that threaten the private sector. That message might resonate for a little, but long term tensions are bound to return.</p>

<p>Only hours after China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) <a href="http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-03/02/content_28401207.htm">released</a> the country’s first strategic document on cyberspace on March 1, which outlined the country’s vision for peaceful cooperation in cyberspace, patriotic Chinese hackers took down the website of a South Korean conglomerate at odds with Beijing.</p>
<p>On March 2 at 12:00 p.m. (Korean Standard Time) a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack originating from China targeted the servers of Lotte Group and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lotte-china-idUSKBN1690HR">crashed</a> the company’s website. The site remained inaccessible in all languages for several hours. Beijing has publicly exerted pressure on Lotte Group since December, when the firm agreed to transfer a plot of land to the South Korean military to host the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, a move China strongly opposes. The pressure reached a fever pitch last week as Lotte Group moved closer to signing the agreement, with Chinese authorities targeting Lotte’s businesses in China and state-media calling for a consumer boycott of Lotte’s products.</p>
<p>Shortly after Lotte Group’s website crashed, Huaxia Hacker Alliance, a Chinese hacker collective, took credit for the attack. In a post on Zhihu, which has since been deleted but <a href="http://mt.sohu.com/it/d20170302/127648702_609556.shtml">reposted</a> elsewhere, the leader of Huaxia, who goes by ObedientDog, bragged about his organization&#8217;s role and named three collaborators—1937CN, PANDA, and Aqi Dog. 1937CN made headlines in July when the patriotic hacker group <a href="http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/49876/hacking/china-1937cn-team-vietnam.html">compromised</a> the announcement screen system at two Vietnamese airports.</p>
<p>While a MoFA official denied any Chinese government involvement in the attack, China has a long history of conveniently turning its back as patriotic hackers attack foreign targets. These operations sometimes have the government’s implicit support, though hackers often simply follow marching orders from nationalistic state-media, which whips up Chinese anger against external threats. With Beijing posing as the champion of a peaceful cyberspace, will officials rein in its patriotic hackers?</p>
<p>The answer so far is maybe. Last week, Chinese authorities <a href="https://twitter.com/n300trg/status/839295545587994624">took down</a> the site of 1937CN, signaling that Beijing might not tolerate patriots that march out of line<strong>.</strong> However, other actors involved in the attack have not faced punishment: the messaging boards of Huaxia Hacker Alliances are still online, so is a <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25544748">second post</a> in which Obedient Dog uses the attack on Lotte Group to plug that his cybersecurity firm is recruiting. Notably, both Huaixa and Aqi Dog advertise themselves as cybersecurity professionals and white-hat hackers (Huaxia’s motto is “hackers do not do evil, but preserve security”). The background of these participants highlights the blurred lines between offense and defense in cyberspace, and the challenges the Chinese government will face separating the offensive hackers from the cybersecurity professionals.</p>
<p>In another post, without a hint of irony, ObedientDog suggests that other “white-hat hackers” join the patriotic struggle. Generally, white-hats find vulnerabilities in software for the defense and typically do not engage in DDoS attacks or own a network for the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_t_3X9MfSAhUHfRoKHd49DsQQFgg0MAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wiktionary.org%2Fwiki%2Flulz&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfkPiwGZHe6gtnNS6IfLkwZgjWHQ&amp;sig2=wLihYsNMw2iJB6MWxgJk_g">lulz</a>. They often view their work as making the internet more secure for all users, regardless of location, and are bound by a professional code to refrain from malicious activity</p>
<p>This definition seems to be lost on many Chinese hackers seeking to serve the public good. In between plugging his own cybersecurity firm, offering advice on how to find a beautiful hacker girlfriends, and fielding technical questions, ObedientDog spends his time on <em>Zhihu </em>ranting about foreign affronts to Chinese pride. And he’s not the only one. Since the 1990s, many Chinese hackers have readily exchanged their white-hats for red-hats 红帽子 whenever they feel their nation is under assault. One of China’s most famous red-hat hackers, Wan Tao, simultaneously ran an IT firm as he <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2136810-2,00.html">hacked</a> foreign targets, including the inboxes of Taiwanese politicians and the White House website. Predictably, Tao never faced repercussions from the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Since passing the 2016 Cybersecurity Law, the Chinese government has vowed to upgrade China’s cybersecurity infrastructure; this will require training legions of young talent to defend Chinese networks. By <a href="http://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2017-02-28/doc-ifyavwcv9254107.shtml">one estimate</a>, China needs over 700,000 experts to meet current cybersecurity needs. Within the last year, the Chinese government and large enterprises have <a href="http://www.china.com.cn/shehui/2017-02/24/content_40354114.htm">formed</a> a cybersecurity volunteer alliance geared towards young people, <a href="http://www.leiphone.com/news/201702/vomOChtWzszhcDez.html">underwritten</a> an online drama show about white-hat hackers, and <a href="http://news.youth.cn/wztt/201701/t20170117_9043772.htm">established</a> a youth cybersecurity competition stylized after game shows. Many of these campaigns cast cybersecurity as a public service. At one recent gala for China’s cybersecurity volunteer alliance, the host likened the young hackers to the selfless warriors in the classic martial arts film <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385004/">House of Flying Daggers</a>. </em></p>
<p>Beijing walks a fine line, as it tries to both energize young hackers with which a messages of public service resonates, but also restrain them from undercutting Beijing’s overall cyber strategy. The shuttering of 1937CN affords Beijing a degree of plausible deniability on the world stage. However, as long as Beijing needs cyber talent to build the country’s cyber capabilities, China will not turn on its patriotic white-hats.</p>

<p><span id="more-4750"></span></p>
<p><strong>Surprise! The CIA spies on people! </strong>Wikileaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/">published a trove</a> of Central Intelligence Agency documents revealing the agency&#8217;s cyber tools to break into smartphones, televisions, and computers. Security experts <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/09/technology/cia-smart-tv-wikileaks-public-hacks/">say</a> the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/wikileaks-publishes-what-it-says-is-trove-of-cia-hacking-tools/">8,761 documents</a> expose nothing dramatically new about CIA espionage, which constitute <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2017/03/some-comments-on-wikileaks-ciavault7.html#.WMLKDW_yuUl">legitimate spying activity</a> and are not particularly sophisticated. And no, you&#8217;re not likely to be of interest to U.S. spooks. Software companies have had a similarly blasé response to the document dump, with both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/apple-says-most-vulnerabilities-in-wikileaks-docs-are-already-patched/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/google-is-the-latest-company-to-brush-off-most-of-the-wikileaks-vulnerabilities/">Google</a> claiming to have already fixed most security vulnerabilities exposed. The documents, however, reveal the CIA&#8217;s use of zero-day vulnerabilities and that has raised questions about the viability of the U.S. government&#8217;s <a href="http://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/vulnerability-disclosure-web-final3.pdf">Vulnerabilities Equity Process</a> (VEP), the process by which the U.S. government decides whether to disclose flaws it finds or buys to software vendors. The leak is nonetheless an embarrassing blow to the CIA, and the FBI has <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/intel-sources-examining-wikileaks-cia-data-to-determine-authenticity/">opened an investigation</a> into the disclosure. If there&#8217;s one good thing to come out of these leaks is the revelation that hackers inside the CIA are the same as hackers outside Langley. They both love <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/a-look-at-the-cias-internal-dank-meme-division/">memes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Listen all of y&#8217;all it&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE">sabotage</a>! </strong>The <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-program-sabotage.html">reports </a>that the United States launched a years-long cyber effort to sabotage North Korea&#8217;s nuclear program. The effort may have succeeded for a time, and perhaps resulted in a series of failed missile tests. President Kim-jong Un ordered an investigation into the failed tests, which lead to the execution of senior officials. According to the <em>Times</em>, the sabotage effort prompted intense debate within the Obama administration as to whether the United States was crossing a red line: if the United States meddled in others&#8217; nuclear supply chains, what would prevent a Russia or China from doing the same to it and render existing nuclear arsenals less safe? Columbia law professor and Council on Foreign Relations fellow Matthew Waxman ponders the legal basis for the operation over at <em><a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/cyber-ops-and-north-korean-missile-systems-three-questions">Lawfare</a></em>.</p>
<p><strong>File under: &#8220;pipe dream.&#8221; </strong>In a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21321&amp;LangID=E">special report</a> submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Council this week, independent expert on privacy Joe Cannataci called for serious reform on government surveillance practices. He called on UN member states to start the negotiation of a treaty to enshrine the right to privacy from surveillance, stating that it’s time to “<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-privacy-un-idUSKBN16F1M3">start reclaiming cyberspace from the menace of over-surveillance</a>.” Cannataci also expressed concern that current surveillance laws in countries such as the United States, France, and Germany choke privacy rights in favor of furthering the transition into the digital age. The question as to whether privacy and security are mutually exclusive remains highly contested worldwide among policymakers, as evidenced by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey this week, who <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/james-comey-privacy-cybersecurity/">remarked</a> that there is “no such thing as absolute privacy in America.”</p>
<p><strong>Still no LinkedIn for Russia. </strong>Russia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/russia-says-nyet-continues-linkedin-block-after-it-refuses-to-store-data-in-russia/">announced</a> this week that it will continue to block access to LinkedIn after the social networking site indicated it would not transfer Russian user data to local servers. LinkedIn has been banned in the country <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/linkedin-is-now-officially-blocked-in-russia/">since November 2016</a> due its violation of a Russian law that stipulates that companies <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-linkedin-russia-ban-idUSKBN16E20Q">must store Russian citizens&#8217; data on Russian soil</a>. Despite its inability to reach an agreement with the Russian government, LinkedIn <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/07/linkedin-russia-data-access/">has said</a> it will continue to be available in the Russian language and that it hopes successful negotiations with Russian authorities are on the horizon.</p>

<p><span id="more-4761"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a roundup of what we know so far:</p>
<p><strong>Did the CIA break the internet?</strong> No. Unless you are already a CIA target, you are unlikely to get hacked by any of these tools. NSA tools work at internet-scale, sucking up as much data as they can legally acquire and sift through it later. According to the Wikileaks dump, the CIA malware is different in that operatives must want to target you specifically, and in some cases, require physical access to implant malware into your iPhone. Unless you&#8217;re a Chinese spy, a member of the self-declared Islamic State group, or selling nuclear material to North Korea, the CIA is not interested in your cat videos. Also, the CIA operations did not break or bypass encrypted messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp. As far as we know, encryption remains <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/blog/2017-03/2017-03-07.html">strong</a>. If someone is already in your phone, they can take screenshots or log your keystrokes&#8211;no amount of encryption will save you from that. Also, according to much of the technical analysis out there, the tools are not particularly sophisticated. CIA operators recycled attacks, techniques, and code that has been used by many others. Still, as always with these reports of vulnerabilities, you should update your phone&#8217;s operating system.</p>

<p><strong>How did this happen?</strong> We don&#8217;t know for sure yet, and the FBI and CIA are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/wikileaks-cia-investigation/index.html?adkey=bn">investigating</a>, but this seems the best explanation so far:</p>

<p><strong>Is there a Russian angle?</strong>  Wikileaks claims the documents came from a whistleblower with a conscience. James Lewis of the Center for International and Strategic Studies believes it is more likely that a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/world/europe/wikileaks-cia-hacking.html">foreign power</a> was behind the leaks. No matter the source, bots have been set up on Twitter to promote <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/08/who-s-behind-the-massive-cia-leak.html">fake stories</a> arguing that the dump proves that the CIA used Russian malware in the hack of the DNC in a false flag operation to tarnish the Kremlin. Moscow will certainly not mind the embarrassment of the Agency, and more distrust among Trump supporters of the intelligence community.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for the VEP? </strong>The VEP, or <a href="http://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/vulnerability-disclosure-web-final3.pdf">Vulnerabilities Equities Process</a>, is a process by which the government decides if it will reveal a software vulnerability to the vendors or keep it for offensive purposes. In the past, government officials say the VEP is biased toward responsible disclosure. NSA Director <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/11/michael-daniel-no-zero-day-stockpile/.">Admiral Mike Rogers</a> has said “by orders of magnitude, the greatest number of vulnerabilities we find, we share.” <a href="https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/healey_vulnerability_equities_process">Jason Healey</a> has estimated that the government holds a small number of zero days, &#8220;dozens of such zero days, far fewer than the hundreds or thousands that many experts have estimated.&#8221; Healey seems to argue that, given the age of the vulnerabilities and their use outside of the United States, <a href="https://twitter.com/Jason_Healey/status/839246398159650817">the CIA did not need to them report to the VEP</a>. Robert Graham uses the leaks to argue that <a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2017/03/some-comments-on-wikileaks-ciavault7.html#.WMA-y2_yu70">the VEP is &#8220;nonsense&#8221;</a>&#8211;largely a public relations exercise to assuage the tech world that the U.S. government is not stockpiling flaws affecting products made by U.S. companies. The intelligence agencies buy vulnerabilities and they are going to use them; &#8220;if they [CIA and NSA] spend millions of dollars buying 0days because it has that value in intelligence operations, they aren&#8217;t going to destroy that value by disclosing to a vendor.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for the split between Silicon Valley and Washington?</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/technology/wikileaks-silicon-valley-spy-agencies.html">It is not good</a>, but it could be worse. The tech companies are going to be angry that the CIA had vulnerabilities and did not report them (here&#8217;s<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2017/03/07/mozilla-statement-on-cia-wikileaks/"> Mozilla&#8217;s statement</a>). This makes everyone worse off. These reports will also be used by foreign governments to increase scrutiny of US tech companies in their markets (the Chinese paper <em>Global Times</em> already ran this <a href="http://world.huanqiu.com/exclusive/2017-03/10271707.html">headline</a>, &#8220;US consulate becomes a hacking center! WikiLeaks once again exposes shocking CIA secrets&#8221;). But the attacks were targeted, did not undermine encryption or the internet backbone, and do not expose thousands or millions of users. This leak will join a growing list of events that keep the two sides apart&#8211;and here I suggested <a href="http://www.cfr.org/technology-and-foreign-policy/rebuilding-trust-between-silicon-valley-washington/p38666">how to bridge the gap</a>&#8211;but will not be in top 3.</p>

<p><span id="more-4754"></span></p>
<p>In February 2017, South Africa introduced a new cybercrime bill to its parliament. It is a revision of a previous <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/invitations/cybercrimesbill2015.pdf">2015 bill</a> that received substantial opposition from South African and international <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/pubs/written-submission-south-africa-cybercrimes-and-cy">civil society</a> organizations and businesses. These groups critiqued the 2015 legislation’s handling of computer-related terrorist activity, copyright offenses, free speech, and investigative powers. In the new 2017 bill, the South African government addresses many of these concerns, producing draft legislation civil society and private groups will more likely support, although some issues remain. The bill also takes important steps towards readying South Africa to cooperate internationally on cybercrime.</p>
<p>The new bill abandons the previous draft’s approaches to copyright infringement, which critics <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/files/2015/11/CybercrimesandCybersecurityBillConsultation-MozillaResponse.pdf">charged</a> went beyond existing South African law. The revised legislation also drops much-criticized provisions on computer-related terrorist activity. The earlier bill defined such activity broadly, criminalizing, for example, causing “feelings of insecurity among . . . the public,” including economic insecurity.</p>
<p>South African and <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/south-africa-draft-cybersecurity-and-cybercrime-bill-misses-the-mark/">international</a> civil society organizations argued that the 2015 bill placed excessive restrictions on free speech. For instance, the 2015 bill prohibited sharing “a data message which advocates, promotes or incites hate, discrimination or violence against a person or group of persons.” South African organization Right2Know <a href="http://www.r2k.org.za/2015/11/30/cybercrimesbill/">criticized this language</a> for violating constitutional protections for <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/constitution/english-web/ch2.html">freedom of expression.</a> The South African <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/constitution/english-web/ch2.html">Constitution</a> only permits restrictions on speech that constitutes war propaganda, incitement to imminent violence, or advocates hatred based on race, ethnicity, gender, or religion that constitutes incitement to cause harm.</p>
<p>The revised bill removes references to hate speech, and, in doing so, moves further from the approach favored by the <a href="https://www.au.int/web/en/treaties/african-union-convention-cyber-security-and-personal-data-protection">African Union Convention on Cybercrime</a>. However, the new legislation includes restrictions on speech that incites property damage&#8211;a limitation not found in the South African Constitution’s provisions on freedom of expression. The revised bill also targets “harmful” data messages, defined broadly as threats of violence or property damage, which might not qualify as incitement to imminent violence under the Constitution (see <a href="http://www.r2k.org.za/2015/11/30/cybercrimesbill/">critique</a> of earlier bill). The bill also defines harmful data messages to include those that are “inherently false” and “aimed at causing mental, psychological, physical or economic harm.” These types of restrictions on expression also may not be constitutional.</p>
<p>Other criticized aspects of the 2015 bill reappear in the new version. Concerns that the government could use the bill could to target <a href="https://cpj.org/2015/12/cpj-urges-south-africa-to-revise-cybercrime-bill-t.php">whistleblowers</a> remain. The revised legislation still grants officials with a warrant the authority to “use or obtain” relevant decryption keys, and electronic service providers must still report cybercrimes “if they are aware or become aware” of them. These provisions suggest the government might be moving towards compelled decryption and service providers might be expected to monitor users.</p>
<p>South Africa <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201701190716.html">claims</a> the legislation substantially expands its jurisdiction concerning cybercrime, compared to existing law. Both 2015 and 2017 versions of the bill give South Africa jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed in its territory or by its nationals and over foreign-origin cybercrimes that have an “effect in the Republic.” This last approach is not a unique expansion of jurisdiction. Countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/business/russian-suspected-of-hacking-us-tech-companies-is-indicted.html">routinely apply</a> this “effects doctrine” in exercising jurisdiction over cybercrime, reflecting <a href="http://www.kentlaw.edu/perritt/conflicts/rest402.html">customary international law</a>.</p>
<p>Claiming jurisdiction, however, is less of a challenge than establishing effective law enforcement cooperation across borders. To give the effects doctrine teeth, countries must cooperate on investigating and extraditing individuals charged with cybercrimes, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/us/politics/russian-hackers-election.html">struggle</a> even for the United States and other developed countries.</p>
<p>The legislation takes steps towards readying South Africa to cooperate with other nations on cybercrime. Both the new and old drafts establish a 24/7 point of contact and dual criminality requirement. The new draft adds sections dealing with a broader range of requestable data (real-time interception, traffic data, archived and indirect communications). These elements mirror sections of the <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185">Budapest Convention on Cybercrime</a>, the main multilateral mechanism for international cooperation on cybercrime.</p>
<p>Despite these parallels, South Africa has not ratified the Budapest Convention, citing concerns over sovereignty. South Africa also has not supported the <a href="https://www.au.int/web/en/treaties/african-union-convention-cyber-security-and-personal-data-protection">African Union Convention</a>, which seeks to harmonize African cybercrime laws. Refraining from multilateral approaches to cybercrime leaves South Africa reliant on existing or newly concluded bilateral agreements, which can be time and resource intensive to set up, slowing cooperation. A go-it-alone approach could leave South Africa at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>That disadvantage aside, the bill’s mutual assistance procedures could turn South Africa into a regional hub for cooperation, like <a href="https://mlat.info/">Brazil</a>, bolstering its place among its neighbors. Consistency with the Budapest Convention could also qualify South Africa for a <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=david+kris+us+uk&amp;*">second-generation cross-border data request agreement </a>with the United States, giving it expedited access to data stored by U.S. companies about South African crimes.</p>
<p>Overall, South Africa’s legislation models a “third way” of approaching cybercrime. South Africa’s government recognizes the importance of legal harmonization, making important adjustments to domestic cybercrime law, while still formally avoiding multilateral institutions that could impinge on its sovereignty. Other global south governments may follow South Africa’s example.</p>

<p><span id="more-4743"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. To amend or not to amend? </strong>Reuters reports that the Trump administration <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-fisa-idUSKBN16855P">intends</a> to seek a &#8220;clean&#8221; re-authorization of section 702 of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which sunsets later this year. Section 702 is the <a href="https://icontherecord.tumblr.com/topics/section-702">legal basis</a> for the National Security Agency&#8217;s intelligence collection efforts targeting non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. It became a lightning rod of controversy when Edward Snowden disclosed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_collection">Upstream</a> programs, both of which exist due to section 702. Privacy and civil liberties advocates in the United States, as well as some members of Congress, want to amend section 702 to prevent what they view is the mass surveillance of people outside the United States. A coalition of human rights organizations have even brought Europe into the fight, asking the European Commission to <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2017/02/Section702CoalitionLetter1.pdf">suspend</a> the Privacy Shield until section 702 is significantly reformed.</p>
<p><strong>2. Speak softly and carry a big stick</strong>. Early this week, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Cyberspace Administration of China <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/01/c_136094734.htm">released</a> China’s first strategic document on cyberspace, which laid out the country’s plan for promoting international cyberspace cooperation. For observers of China’s internet cyber diplomacy, the document rehashes <a href="https://medium.com/china-media-project/china-s-cyber-diplomacy-b4fa20a210f#.dsv95hs7k">a familiar vision</a> of international cyber cooperation rooted in the principal of cyber sovereignty. This includes familiar policy prescriptions as well: the document advocates reforming ICANN and the UN Internet Governance Forum and promoting bilateral cooperation on issues like &#8220;cyber terrorism&#8221; and cybercrime. Notably, while the document paints a rosy image of “win-win cooperation” in cyberspace, China is evidently not relying on harmonious cyber relations. “Building national defense cyberspace capabilities is an important part of China&#8217;s military modernization, which complies with the principal of active defense,” the document said.</p>
<p><strong>3. Houston, we have a problem. </strong>“<a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2017/aws-cloud-storage-internet-freaking/">High error rates</a>” at data centers snowballed into a five-hour “<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/01/aws_s3_outage/">mega-outage</a>” for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Web Services&#8217; Simple Storage Service</a> (S3) earlier this week. The meltdown affected software ranging from smart phone applications, to web services, to internet of things devices, all reliant on Amazon S3 cloud-based storage. The tech giant <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/02/aws_s3_crash_result_of_fatfingered_command/">chalked up</a> the massive outage to an Amazon staffer&#8217;s mistyped command. Oops.</p>
<p><strong>4. China enters the race for 5G dominance. </strong><em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-huawei-battles-to-own-the-next-generation-of-wireless-technology-1488114002">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> profiled Huawei&#8217;s efforts at becoming a powerhouse in setting the standards for 5G wireless. Largely shut out from the 3G standards-setting process, Huawei successfully got its foot in the door during 4G development, ultimately becoming a principal supplier of wireless technology. Now, Huawei is further ramping up research and development, employing some 80,000 staffers who exclusively focus on 5G capabilities. Huawei is trying to elbow out its European and U.S. competitors in standards setting bodies, with hopes that its patents and technology become the defacto standard for 5G equipment.</p>
<p><strong>5. Should sex offenders be allowed on social media? </strong>An attempt by North Carolina to bar sex offenders from using social media sites did not sit well with the U.S. Supreme Court this week. The presiding justices indicated they would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/us/politics/supreme-court-north-carolina-sex-offenders-social-media.html?_r=1">strike down the North Carolina law</a> on the basis of the First Amendment, arguing that platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become a critical communication channel for political discussion, debate, and even job opportunities. The Court maintained that to refuse sex offenders access to those services would be to deny them not only their constitutional right to speak, but also their constitutional right to information.</p>

Since its inception in 2011, RightsCon&#8211;the annual conference of Access Now&#8211;has been one of the primary gatherings where human rights activists, politicians, technologists, scholars, and businesses <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/cms/assets/uploads/2017/02/RC2017-draft-program-v1.0.pdf">discuss issues</a> at the intersection between human rights promotion and the internet. Unlike previous iterations, the stakes for this year&#8217;s event are undeniably higher given the current disruptive political environment that threatens human rights in real space and cyberspace.</p>
<p><span id="more-4719"></span></p>
<p>Today, reading the RightsCon <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/cms/assets/uploads/2016/07/RC2016-Outcomes-Report.pdf">report from the 2016 meeting</a> is surreal given what has transpired since. Brexit and Donald Trump’s election sent shock waves through the domestic politics of democracies, creating a tsunami of nationalism and populism in Europe and the United States dangerous to individual rights and international cooperation needed to protect rights globally. The post-<em>coup</em> crackdown in Turkey became emblematic of rising government repression around the world.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/4800/2017/en/">report</a> for 2016, Amnesty International argues “the world in 2016 became a darker and more unstable place.” Last year, “the idea of human dignity and equality,” asserts Amnesty International, came “under vigorous and relentless assault from narratives of blame, fear and scapegoating, propagated by those who sought to take or cling on to power at almost any cost.”</p>
<p>This global assault involved repression of online speech and political activity. Freedom House <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2016">concluded</a> that 2016 marked the sixth consecutive year internet freedom has declined. Last year also witnessed governments, political parties, media entities and personalities, and individual leaders exploiting cyberspace to spread fear, deepen political divisions, incite intolerance, and disseminate false information. The “fake news” problem grew so bad that it became an <a href="https://qz.com/889506/world-economic-forum-davos-fake-news-facebook/">urgent human rights challenge</a>. The Russian “hack and leak” campaign during the U.S. election has alarm bells ringing about cyber-meddling in democratic elections, a development endangering the importance the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> assign to voting.</p>
<p>Compounding these problems are fears that nationalism and populism in democracies threaten the liberal international order built after World War II. This angst usually focuses on risks President Trump’s “America First” strategy presents to the military and economic pillars of this order just as China and Russia challenge American influence. But weakening the order also bodes ill for human rights. According to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-twilight-of-the-liberal-world-order/">Robert Kagan</a>, the liberal order supports “universal principles of individual rights . . . over ethnic, racial, religious, national, or tribal differences.” As frustrated as human rights advocates get with the liberal order, its fracturing would be a human rights nightmare in real space and cyberspace.</p>
<p>These seismic changes in domestic and international politics disrupt the contexts in which human rights problems must be addressed. The list of human rights issues in cyberspace was long and growing before the events of the latter half of 2016 and early 2017 unfolded. Earlier RightsCon meetings reflect the daunting challenges human rights activists, groups, and intergovernmental bodies faced in less poisonous and polarized political circumstances than prevail today.</p>
<p>But, even in more benign circumstances, progress—if achieved at all—proved difficult and, at times, ephemeral. Controversies sparked by Edward Snowden’s disclosures, such as the threat government surveillance poses for online privacy, remain contentious because, in part, many governments have increased their surveillance powers. The constellation of human rights issues in cyberspace associated with Snowden’s actions now seems quaint compared to what RightsCon 2017 has to navigate.</p>
<p>Most of those gathering in Brussels are hardwired for defiance in the face of threats to human rights. The most pressing questions target the United States and other democracies and seek answers about the direction of human rights policies in cyberspace. <a href="https://na-production.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Internet__Freedom_Agenda_12_21.pdf">Experts</a> have called on the Trump administration to support internet freedom. <a href="http://www.internetgovernance.org/2017/02/12/the-cybersecurity-executive-orders-a-tale-of-two-trumps/">Drafts</a> of a new executive order on cybersecurity contain language on internet freedom, but, as in many policy areas, finding consistency and concrete details in the administration’s approach to internet freedom is difficult.</p>
<p>Any initiatives on internet freedom would have to accord with the administration’s overall approach to human rights. On that score, the America First strategy provides little basis for optimism that President Trump will develop a coherent approach on human rights and integrate it across U.S. foreign policy. The furor over the administration’s immigration actions suggests domestic fights over individual rights might overshadow international human rights issues in U.S. policy for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>So, with the United States distracted, perhaps it really matters that this year’s RightsCon is in Brussels because “the heart of European policymaking” is the best place for the “most impactful RightsCon yet.” The impact remains to be seen, but the multiplying dangers for human rights in cyberspace make the Brussels meeting the most important RightsCon yet.</p>

<p><span id="more-4734"></span></p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg recently published a <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/02/17/mark-zuckerberg-manifesto-text/">manifesto</a> about the future of Facebook and our increasingly technology-saturated world. In it, he argued &#8220;Connecting everyone to the internet is…necessary for building an informed community.&#8221; For those familiar with Zuckerberg&#8217;s statements, this is a familiar claim. He argues that not only should we connect everyone in the world to the internet, but that doing so is a necessary step in solving some of the planet&#8217;s most pernicious problems.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg is not alone in this thinking. Huge <a href="https://share.america.gov/globalconnect/">sums of money</a> have been invested in <a href="https://x.company/loon/">projects</a> that connect the billions of people who lack an internet connection. These schemes tend to present digital connectivity as a mechanism to achieve key social and economic developmental goals. This is especially true in Africa&#8211;the part of the world with both the lowest incomes and rates of connectivity.</p>
<p>Because of the vigor with which such claims are made, and the vast resources that tech companies are able to deploy, we decided to examine the actually existing evidence base that might support them. In a <a href="http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/view/1785">new paper</a>, we set out to test those claims.</p>
<p>In it, we analyzed a wide range of policy documents and reports, and found widespread claims that increasing connectivity will lead to economic growth and social development. <a href="http://www.impactoftheinternet.com/pdf/Dalberg_Impact_of_Internet_Africa_Full_Report_April2013_vENG_Final.pdf">One report</a> for instance, notes that “The internet is a tremendous, undisputed force for economic growth and social change.” What is noteworthy is that those reports tend to either not cite evidence or support claims with non-rigorous and non-peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>Some go further to assert than not only will more connectivity lead to growth, but can also reduce inequality despite the fact that there is little comprehensive evidence to suggest that it can actually do so. <a href="http://thewebindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Web_Index_24pp_November2014.pdf">Those</a> <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_IT_Report_2015.pdf">reports</a> are sprinkled with quotes such as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today, armed with little more than a smartphone, anyone — regardless of where they were born or how much they earn — can start a business, record a music video, crowdfund an invention, take courses with Nobel Prize-winning professors, or even launch a successful campaign for office.”</p>
<p>“[T]he impact of ICTs on income growth and poverty alleviation are undeniable, and greater adoption of ICTs in lower-income groups will accelerate income gains at the base of the economic pyramid.”</p></blockquote>
<p>None of this is to say that there are not some responsible, nuanced and careful assessments of the impacts of connectivity. The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2016">2016 World Development Report</a> from the World Bank is measured in its assessment that increased connectivity has boosted growth in some instances, but that overall it has created winners and losers. However, such publications are a small minority.</p>
<p>The question then is why, in the absence of a solid evidence base, such fantastic visions about the transformative power of digital connectivity abound. Our assertion is that ‘self-evident’ discourses of connectivity allow policymakers to point to shiny new technological fixes rather than focus on the messy business of how the political economy of any given context works to (usually unfairly) allocate power and wealth.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, James Ferguson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anti-Politics_Machine">famously asked</a> ‘what do aid programs do besides fail to help poor people?’ Our worry in the context of visions like those of Mark Zuckerberg is not just that the massive resources invested in connecting the world&#8217;s disconnected will be wasted. It is also that by framing development and inequality as something that can be solved with more connectivity, we distract from the real structural economic processes that serve to widen inequalities and produce poverty. We should be concerned when developmental interventions don&#8217;t work. But we should be even more worried when we think important issues have been effectively addressed when they have not.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that information and communication technologies do not have a role to play in international development. Yet we do have a responsibility to ensure that, when so much is at stake, more of our interventions are grounded in a solid evidence base from the world&#8217;s economic margins rather than the hopes of Silicon Valley billionaires.</p>

<p><span id="more-4722"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. File under: Not entirely </strong><strong>surprising. </strong>Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu has <a href="http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/8b7532462dd0495d9f756c9ae7d2ff3c/russian-military-continues-massive-upgrade">officially admitted</a> the existence of “information warfare troops” as an established branch of Russia’s military. Russia had yet to formally acknowledge the existence of forces specializing in the dissemination of subversive propaganda in an effort to influence global public opinion. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39062663">revelation</a> comes as U.S. intelligence agencies are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber-idUSKBN15X0OE?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social">investigating</a> Russia’s alleged interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and amidst growing concern regarding Russian ability to influence upcoming elections in Western Europe. The European Union is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/world/europe/europe-combats-a-new-foe-of-political-stability-fake-news.html?_r=0">reportedly</a> already taking measures to combat Russian efforts. It recently announced the creation of a <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/2116/%20Questions%20and%20Answers%20about%20the%20East%20StratCom%20Task%20Force">special task force</a> designed to combat disinformation campaigns that Russia might launch in a year when the Germans, French and Dutch all go to the polls.</p>
<p><strong>2. Alexa’s right to remain silent. </strong>Alexa, Amazon&#8217;s computerized personal assistant service, may have overheard a murder in Bentonville, Arkansas last November, but Amazon is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/02/amazon-wont-disclose-if-alexa-witnessed-a-murder/">refusing</a> to let investigating authorities get their hands on any of the device’s cloud-stored data from the time period in question. Amazon <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3473799-Alexa.html">contested</a> the search warrant recently issued by the Bentonville Police Department on the grounds that Amazon users’ recorded audio (and Alexa’s responses) are protected under the First Amendment, and that granting access to the electronic personal assistant’s data raises constitutional privacy concerns. The case and its implications call to mind last year’s unsuccessful efforts by the federal government to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/16/us/san-bernardino-shooter-phone-apple/">force Apple to unlock an iPhone</a> used by a gunman in a shooting in San Bernardino, California.</p>
<p><strong>3. The White House reaches out to Silicon Valley. </strong>As the United States awaits the issuing of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-31/trump-delays-signing-cyber-order-to-focus-on-immigration-suit">delayed cybersecurity executive order</a>, the Trump administration has been seeking the advice of the tech industry. Administration associates have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-18/trump-team-sounding-out-tech-firms-ahead-of-delayed-cyber-order">reportedly</a> consulted several technology firms ahead of the rollout of the order for feedback on a new national cybersecurity strategy. Silicon Valley has responded favorably to the administration’s discreet outreach in hopes of both contributing to cyber policy and generally strengthening ties with Washington. As I highlight in a <a href="http://www.cfr.org/technology-and-foreign-policy/rebuilding-trust-between-silicon-valley-washington/p38666">recent report</a>, the relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley will likely face its fair share of trials under the Trump administration, already evidenced by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/technology/technology-companies-fight-trump-immigration-order-in-court.html">recent clashes</a> regarding the immigration executive order.</p>
<p><strong>4. Border security going digital?</strong> The Department of Homeland Security is receiving <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/320461-tech-advocacy-groups-slam-dhs-call-to-demand-foreign-travelers-passwords">significant backlash</a> regarding its recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/passwords-for-social-media-accounts-could-be-required-for-some-to-enter-country/">suggestion</a> that vetting procedures should require “<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/21/campaign_against_digital_border_searches/">select non-citizens</a>” to give up their social media passwords in order to be granted entry into the United States. Technology advocates and lawmakers are joining security experts and civil liberties groups in <a href="https://cdt.org/insight/no-to-dhs-social-media-password-requirement/">condemning</a> the proposed measure, arguing that digital searches at the border will undermine basic human rights to privacy while simultaneously failing to bolster security.</p>

<p>After almost two decades of overseeing the internet naming and addressing system, the U.S. government transferred the responsibility to a coalition of industry, civil society, and government stakeholders in October 2016. The United States relinquished its role to demonstrate to emerging countries its commitment to significant private sector involvement in the operation of the internet.</p>
<p>The move had overwhelming support from industry and like-minded governments, but <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2016/05/18/ted-cruz-wants-to-shrink-government-except-when-it-comes-to-the-internet/">some policymakers</a>, <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-opposes-president-obama-plan-to-surrender-american-internet" target="_blank">including Donald J. Trump</a> when he was running for office, saw the announcement as an ill-considered loss of direct control over the most important communications medium ever developed. Given that the transition is effectively irreversible, the United States needs to respond to new institutional and political realities and find alternative ways to maintain its influence on internet governance.</p>
<p>Stifel argues the U.S. government can do this by collaborating with industry to enhance the internet’s reliability and resilience by tackling <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2016/10/the_dyn_ddos_attack_shows_how_vulnerable_we_ve_made_ourselves.html" target="_blank">vulnerabilities</a> that permit foreign governments to question the current multistakeholder approach. Additionally, the U.S. government should expand efforts to foster and train leaders in emerging internet markets.</p>

<p><span id="more-4680"></span></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://broadbandcommission.org/Documents/ITU_discussion-paper_Davos2017.pdf">International Telecommunication Union</a>, roughly 75 percent of Africans are not connected to the internet. This dismal statistic has turned the continent into a laboratory to test innovative public policy- and market-based solutions to improve connectivity. Installing free Wi-Fi hotspots has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the challenges of coverage, cost and network quality in South Africa and other countries across region. However, it will take more than just free Wi-Fi to significantly increase connectivity.</p>
<p>Fixed broadband networks (e.g. laying cable) are too expensive to install and operate for African internet users. Mobile technologies can be deployed more quickly and cheaply and increase mobile phone ownership. However, the cost of communicating is still relatively expensive. A <a href="https://www.westerncape.gov.za/assets/departments/economic-development-tourism/digital_readiness_full_report.pdf">digital readiness assessment</a> study in the Western Cape province found on average citizens spend 20.1 percent of their individual income on mobile service that is voice, SMS, data and any monthly mobile subscriptions.</p>
<p>Unlike data plans, free public Wi-Fi is just that for the end user: free. That makes the provision of public Wi-Fi attractive to public authorities looking to improve internet access, especially given the growing penetration of smartphones across Africa. <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/africa-hits-557m-unique-mobile-subs-smartphones-to-dominate-by-2020/?gclid=CjwKEAiAoOvEBRDD25uyu9Lg9ycSJAD0cnByWx0HPnWNKNL4D_D1KteIzt0XjQ7H7McWb7KG7WwztBoCzvPw_wcB">Data</a> suggests that there were roughly 226 million smartphone users in 2015 and is expected to rise to 720 million by 2020.</p>
<p>Governments have begun to require the provision of Wi-Fi as a condition of public network investment and infrastructure upgrades. For example, the Western Cape government requires Neotel, an internet service provider, set aside a portion of bandwidth to be allocated for a local Wi-Fi hotspot at the public buildings it is contracted to connect. Similarly, the cities of Tshwane and Cape Town have required that new government buildings establish a functioning Wi-Fi hotspot with free uninhibited access to anyone in the vicinity. In both cities, schools, libraries, health facilities, parks and squares now offer free Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.researchictafrica.net/publications/Other_publications/2016_Public_Wi-Fi_Policy_Paper_-_Developing_Smart_Public_Wi-Fi_in_South_Africa.pdf">business models for free Wi-Fi are varied</a>, but overall, the local authorities end up subsidizing a daily data cap to be used by anyone with a Wi-Fi-enabled device to do with as they please.</p>
<p>Having government subsidize internet access is risky. Will people use their newfound access to browse cat videos or something more productive? Recent research <a href="http://www.researchictafrica.net/publications/Other_publications/2016_Public_Wi-Fi_Policy_Paper_-_Developing_Smart_Public_Wi-Fi_in_South_Africa.pdf">we undertook in South Africa</a> suggests that individuals availing themselves of free Wi-Fi were doing so for job seeking, student assignments and information inquiries more than any other activities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are still some problems facing the African users of public Wi-Fi. First, the Wi-Fi is provided in mostly urban areas, and therefore exclude rural populations. Second, many public spaces in urban and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peri-urbanisation">peri-urban</a> areas are unsafe at night, making internet access a daytime affair. Third, Wi-Fi-enabled devices are not the most affordable devices on the market, which limits the accessibility of feature phone owners and those who have no device at all. Fourth, the sustainability of publicly-funded Wi-Fi projects is uncertain given the dynamic nature of the sector and budgetary constraints in developing economies. This threatens the longevity of such operators as well as the health and competitiveness of the private sector.</p>
<p>There are also challenges beyond technology that affect internet accessibility and use in Africa. Mozilla recently funded research conducted in Nigeria, Kenya and Rwanda.<a href="http://researchictafrica.net/ria_rap/2017/01/25/navigating-affordability/"> According to the study</a>, digital literacy remains a challenge as some individuals, particularly in rural areas, do not have the skills to navigate the internet.</p>
<p>Apart from the lack of devices and digital know-how, public perceptions of the internet also hinder access. Some users shy away from internet use given the nature of some online content, particularly fake news or malicious content. Non-users also express a general mistrust of the internet, which may be attributed to a lack of understanding of what the internet is. Gender disparities can also hinder online participation, especially in rural areas where women have described their partners restricting them from going online.</p>
<p>Providing free public Wi-Fi is an innovative and affordable way to improve connectivity in Africa. However it is by no means a silver bullet. More evidence-based research could identify the full extent of the limitations of free public Wi-Fi and identify strategies to improve internet accessibility in Africa. Some of this research will come later this year, once we complete household and individual surveys in nine African countries to better understand internet usage and accessibility.</p>

<p><span id="more-4666"></span></p>
<p><strong>Q: One central criticism of the multistakeholder model is that it isn’t representative enough in that it is dominated by U.S. and Western interests at the expense of emerging economies, who make up the fastest growing share of the internet population. How do you respond?</strong></p>
<p>There is no question there are inequities in participation, and they are often driven by resources and capacity. The world is a very unequal place, and I think we would be shocked if that inequality wasn’t replicated—to some degree—in global governance. That said, it is important to note this is not unique to internet governance. And in fact I think ICANN does a better than average job addressing it. In part ICANN has substantial revenues that permit it to offer assistance to some participants from poorer nations. But I also think ICANN takes the multistakeholder model seriously and tries to be open and inclusive to all. Of course it doesn’t always work. Remember too that internet governance is not only about users. It is also about hardware, software, and technologies in general, and of course those are heavily skewed toward Western nations. In fact, I’d say California probably dominates more than almost any other place. But of course this too isn’t surprising: California more or less invented the internet and is the home of many of the most important global tech firms.</p>
<p><strong>Q:Now that the U.S. government has ceded its oversight role, isn’t there a fear that some countries still unhappy with perceived U.S. control over the internet will push for more, like moving ICANN out of California?</strong></p>
<p>That is definitely an issue that some have raised, and I imagine that President Trump and his policies on many issues have only fueled that fire. If it happens, Ted Cruz will surely say I told you so. Still, I think it is unlikely. ICANN already has a presence in a number of other jurisdictions, such as Singapore and Geneva. That allows it to have a more global footprint. It could, I suppose, shift more and more activity to those locations, or to new ones. But I think in the end it won’t. ICANN is also incorporated as a California non-profit, which would make a move hard, but not impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Governments can advise ICANN through the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), though some countries, including in Europe, Latin America and Asia, have criticized it for being ineffectual given that ICANN can reject its advice. Does this pose a risk to the viability of ICANN?</strong></p>
<p>I think it essential to ICANN’s multistakeholder model that no one sector dominates. So it is a feature, not a bug, that the GAC is not in control. The ICANN board is in control, and the aspiration—and largely the reality—is that the board is somewhat reflective of the full internet community universe. It is of course possible that this very feature will drive governments to seek a new mode of governing the internet in which they are in charge. In my article I argued that concern drove a fair bit of the decision making by the U.S. government. But practically, I think that is hard to achieve. As I understand the technology it <em>could</em> happen, but it would require a lot of coordination and a lot of complex politics to occur. And probably the internet would end up fractured rather than whole.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you think that China’s concept of cyber sovereignty is incompatible with the multistakeholder model? What are the implications?</strong></p>
<p>China wants to treat the internet as another resource that states control. The appeal of the rhetoric of cyber sovereignty is that it sounds sensible to so many people: why wouldn’t we want sovereignty over cyberspace? But of course in practice we know how that works already in China, and it is not good. And it is not compatible with the multistakeholder model because that model expressly treats the state as just one of many important actors on the stage. It is not the defining actor or the final decision maker. For China, which isn’t a fan of private actor input in almost any decision making, the ICANN model is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The IANA transition is irreversible. However, given that President Trump, as a candidate criticized the transition, how do you think that will change the United States’ relationship with ICANN and the world on these issues over the course of his presidency?</strong></p>
<p>I think President Trump’s views on ICANN per se are probably less of a problem than his views on nearly everything else. The idea of a quasi-international organization based in the United States seems slightly nutty to a lot of people today—and I don’t just mean those on the right who want to see the United Nations kicked out of New York. But at the end of the day I doubt ICANN will change much or that Trump will try to change it much. But given that nearly every prediction I had about Trump has been proven wrong, I hesitate to say that with much certainly.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How probable is it that another jolt, like the Snowden revelations, could upend the current model and build momentum for a multilateral solution?</strong></p>
<p>In my article I argued that Snowden’s revelations about the National Security Agency (NSA) cast U.S. tech firms in a bad light—as well as the U.S. government itself. That pushed the multilateral effort forward, and that in turn encouraged the Obama administration to move faster on the transition. More of that kind of thing may just strengthen the general commitment to multistakeholderism. And I guess at this point I would be surprised if anything surprised anyone about the NSA. We know it is extremely powerful and skilled and that nearly any form of communication is at risk. I can’t be sure there isn’t more that may shock, but the cat is out of the bag at this point.</p>

One of them was APT28&#8211;also known as Fancy Bear which the U.S. government has <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf">attributed to Russia&#8217;s intelligence services</a>&#8211;in potential violation of a Russia-China cyber <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/world/europe/russia-and-china-sign-cooperation-pacts.html?_r=0">non-aggression pact signed in 2015</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike certain western cybersecurity companies more willing to attribute cyber activity to a particular state, Qihoo&#8217;s reports can sometimes be frustratingly vague and shirk attribution. Its new report identifies thirty-six APTs active in China in 2016, including the actors behind <a href="https://securelist.com/analysis/publications/75533/faq-the-projectsauron-apt/">ProjectSauron</a> and APT28/Fancy Bear, and notes that universities were the primary victims, followed by the private sector and government institutions. Aside from noting that APT28/Fancy Bear was active in China, the report is silent on whether it aimed to compromise specific targets or industries, or was simply looking to use Chinese computers for their command and control infrastructure.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise that Russia and China spy on each other. Despite their public appearances, both countries have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split">traditionally been wary of each other</a> and that skepticism extends to <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2016/06/30/despite-cyber-agreements-russia-and-china-are-not-as-close-as-you-think/">cyberspace</a>. Last year, in its report detailing the decline of Chinese state-sponsored activity against U.S. targets, FireEye noted that <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-china-espionage.pdf">Chinese actors tried to compromise</a> Russian defense contractors and engineering firms in the energy sector. Kaspersky has also noted that Chinese activity against Russian targets <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/chinese-cyberspies-pivot-to-russia-in-wake-of-obama-xi-pact/d/d-id/1324242">has increased significantly in recent months</a>. However, it is unclear whether this increase was state-sanctioned or just Chinese freelancers and moonlighters looking elsewhere given that U.S. targets were off-limits in light of the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/25/remarks-president-obama-and-president-xi-peoples-republic-china-joint">Obama-Xi deal</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Georgia',serif; color: #333333;">What makes APT28’s activity in China particularly significant is the notoriety it has accrued over the past few years. The cyberattacks attributed to APT28 include <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/mach/technology/election-cyberattacks-pro-russia-hackers-have-been-accused-past-n673246">conducting operations</a> against the Ukrainian Central Election Commission (CEC) in May 2014, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37590375">compromising the networks</a> of France’s TV5 Monde in 2015, and most recently <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">hacking</a> the U.S. Democratic National Committee over the course of 2016. </span></p>
<p>If APT28&#8211;known to be operated by Russian intelligence services&#8211;is active in China, then it is would appear to violate an <a href="http://government.ru/media/files/5AMAccs7mSlXgbff1Ua785WwMWcABDJw.pdf">agreement</a> Presidents Xi and Putin signed in 2015. That agreement said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each Party has an equal right to the protection of the information resources of their state against misuse and unsanctioned interference, including computer attacks against them. Each Party shall not exercise such actions with respect to the other Party and shall assist the other Party in the realization of said right.</p></blockquote>
<p>Assessing the deal, Russian cyber expert Elaine Korzak <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2015/08/20/the-next-level-for-russia-china-cyberspace-cooperation/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two sentences, in conjunction, could be read in a way to keep Russia and China from using “computer attacks” against each other. [&#8230;] On the other hand, the language of this provision is strikingly vague. Phrases such as “misuse” and “unsanctioned interference” could obviously be interpreted quite differently by both sides leaving significant loopholes in the scope of the provision.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, APT28&#8217;s activities could constitute a violation of the deal if Beijing interprets the text as a no-hacking pact.</p>
<p>Qihoo, like its American and European counterparts, produces these reports for marketing and advertising, but they raise an interesting policy challenge for Beijing. Chinese leaders hope to build a strong domestic cybersecurity industry, able to compete with foreign firms, and defend domestic networks and identify attackers. But even if Chinese policymakers wanted to confront Moscow on the reported espionage, they are unlikely to turn to a cybersecurity company for public attribution. It would set a precedent of the types of evidence that could be offered to prove who was behind a hacking attack, and there are numerous APT reports that point the finger at China using similar techniques. In fact, in the past, Beijing has harshly criticized these reports as unscientific and unprofessional.</p>
<p>The ambiguity of the phrasing in the Sino-Russia pact, the desire not to set a precedent on private actors and attribution, the demands of the bilateral relationship&#8211;these are all reasons why Beijing is likely to do nothing public in response to Russian hacking. China will hack Russia, Russia will hack China, and Beijing and Moscow will point to their non-aggression pact as a sign of friendship and cooperation.</p>

The link contained an article from RT, formerly known as Russia Today&#8211;a tool of the Russian government. The link appeared during our robust sharing of ideas, not as a warning about Russian propaganda. But, there, in my email inbox was a manifestation of Russian information warfare.</p>
<p><span id="more-4629"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lest you think me paranoid, look at the </span><a href="http://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=995"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handbook of Russian Information Warfare</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/keir-giles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keir Giles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chatham House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handbook</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for NATO personnel who have not “studied Russian principles of war fighting” but who should understand “current and projected Russian operations in the information and cyber domains.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Handbook </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">deserves a broader audience. By drawing on Russian and Western sources, Giles explains basic concepts, objectives, historical development, implementation, and likely future of Russian information warfare. With the 2016 election “hack and leak” campaign fading from headlines, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handbook </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a warning about an information conflict Russia is waging to obtain strategic advantage over the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particularly valuable are Giles’ efforts to demonstrate how differently Russia thinks about information warfare compared to the United States and its NATO allies. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handbook </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows that, for Russia, information communicated through all media is simultaneously a weapon, target, and operational domain in peace and war. Giles quotes a Russian expert arguing that winning “information confrontations” achieves strategic victory “in the defeat of an enemy’s armed forces[,] . . . the capture of his territory, destruction of his economic potential, and overthrow of his political system.” Here, “information” has no independent value. Facts and lies, truth and deceit are equally valuable.</span></p>
<p>Russia’s approach does not privilege cyber-enabled information, but the internet makes Moscow’s information operations “cheaper, simpler, and more permanent than in previous decades when the primary medium was newspapers.” Russia exploits the internet through “sock puppet media outlets,” troll farms and campaigns, and automated botnets in order to engage in information warfare at an unprecedented scale, speed, sophistication, and intensity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handbook </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">details how Russia integrates information warfare techniques into its political, diplomatic, and military toolkits. This integration is manifest in spheres of armed conflict (e.g., Crimea, Ukraine, and Syria) and in non-military contestation over power and influence. As Giles observes, in Russian thinking, “there are no rear areas” in information warfare. Equally worrying is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handbook</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s conclusion that Russia is constantly developing its capabilities, tactics, and targets such that “future campaigns will not resemble the ones seen to date.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handbook </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not develop a policy agenda for responding to Russian information warfare. However, Giles observes that “Euro-Atlantic . . . ‘post-fact’ or ‘post-truth’ political environments” mean that, for Russian information operations against the West, “much of its work has already been done.” Giles does not pursue this point, but President Trump and his administration do, indeed, unwittingly function as a troll farm and botnet for Russian information warfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a candidate, president-elect, and president, Trump has attacked Congress, the judiciary, civil servants, the intelligence community, the media, American corporations, NATO, European Union, and U.S. allies. This onslaught has involved a torrent of deceit, distortion, deception, and “alternative facts” from the president and his advisors. Meanwhile, President Trump </span><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/02/05/trump_says_respects_killer_putin_in_o_reilly_fox_super_bowl_interview.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declares his respect for Vladimir Putin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeks better relations with Russia, ignores the implications of Russian interference in the U.S. elections, and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/04/oreilly-told-trump-that-putin-is-a-killer-trumps-reply-you-think-our-countrys-so-innocent/?utm_term=.1cb207bb43d7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Russian state violence at home and abroad with U.S. behavior.</span></p>
<p>These attacks on American institutions and allies, the political falsehoods, and the pro-Russian views spread through all media channels, including those in the United States and abroad that proliferate “fake news” over the internet and provide sustenance for the divisive echo chambers of social media. Like Russian information operations, the Trump administration’s behavior damages the legitimacy of American leadership and power, sows doubt and confusion about what is actually happening, and dilutes resistance to Russian actions, interests, and influence.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This environment proves deleterious for the infrequent administration statements that take a firmer line against Russia, such as </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/haley-russia-un/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">those from Nikki Haley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. In particular, these statements project dissonance within the administration rather than solidarity in the White House and between the United States and its allies on a strategy for addressing the threats Russia presents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handbook </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasizes, Russian information warfare thinking anticipates that trolls and bots not under Kremlin control will amplify the messages and effects of Russia’s own information operations. However, having a U.S. president, his administration, and his own networks of disinformation playing these roles is probably beyond the wildest dreams of Russian strategists and tacticians of information warfare. Putin will not squander this opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span id="more-4672"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Ireland vs. Facebook. </strong>U.S.-EU data transfer mechanisms came under renewed fire this week as the Irish Data Protection Commissioner <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-privacy-facebook-idUSKBN15M1K8">challenged the validity</a> of Facebook’s model contracts, arguing that the European Union’s top court should review their validity. Model contracts are common legal agreements used by thousands of firms that ensure European privacy regulations are met during the transatlantic transfer of EU citizens’ personal data. The model contracts are one of three transfer mechanisms, the other two being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_corporate_rules">binding corporate rules</a> and the much vaunted <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">Privacy Shield</a>. The data protection commissioners of all EU member states are slated to review effectiveness of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36893920">Privacy Shield later this year</a>. Combined with <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/cyber/2017/02/09/president-trumps-unlikely-effect-u-s-eu-tech-relationship/">EU skepticism of the Trump administration</a>, it is entirely possible that the two most prominent transatlantic transfer mechanisms fall apart this year.</p>
<p><strong>2. China establishes review commission for foreign tech. </strong>Earlier this week, China’s internet regulators <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1031517.shtml">moved</a> to create a cybersecurity review commission to vet all foreign technology before it is used in government or critical sectors such as finance, energy, and telecommunications. The commission makes good on a goal of China’s controversial cybersecurity law, which is to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-approves-cybersecurity-law-1478491064">ensure</a> technology is “secure and controllable,” especially when used in government. Although the law formulates much needed national cybersecurity standards, critics say the Chinese government  is closing itself off from foreign technology. Responding to criticism, government scholar Qin An argued in <em><a href="http://news.163.com/17/0207/01/CCKQN5QL000187V5.html">People’s Daily</a></em> that reviewing foreign technology before it is used in critical sectors is the “standard configuration” in most advanced countries. However, foreign firms worry that the Chinese government’s extensive list of sectors that fall under “critical information infrastructure” will seriously disadvantaged their products in the Chinese market.</p>
<p><strong>3. Introducing Tallinn 2.0. </strong>The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence launched the <a href="https://ccdcoe.org/tallinn-manual-20-international-law-applicable-cyber-operations-be-launched.html">Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations</a>. The manual sets out what international law applies to state actions in cyberspace that fall below the threshold of an armed conflict. That stands in contrast to the first <a href="https://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/356296245.pdf">Tallinn manual</a>, released in 2013, that identified the rules that bound state action in cyberspace during an armed conflict. Both efforts, led by <a href="https://www.usnwc.edu/MichaelSchmitt">Michael Schmitt</a> and sponsored by the government of the Netherlands, give states a sense of what cyber operations they can legally carry out in peacetime and during a time of conflict. Schmitt provides more detail over at <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/37559/tallinn-manual-2-0-international-law-cyber-operations/"><em>Just Security</em></a>. Over at <em>Lawfare</em>, Andrew Keane Woods applauds the effort but <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/tallinn-manual-20-sovereignty-10">wonders</a> whether it makes sense to build a manual around a concept of sovereignty that no longer makes sense in the digital era.</p>
<p><strong>4. Seriously, no one saw him walk out with the crown jewels over the course of twenty years? </strong>A grand jury <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/government-contractor-facing-federal-indictment-willful-retention-national-defense">indicted</a> former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Harold Martin with over twenty criminal counts of willful retention of highly sensitive national defense information. The documents found in his home and car include classified materials from U.S. Cyber Command, the Central Intelligence Agency, the NSA, and the National Reconnaissance Office taken between 1996 and 2016. One rumor circulating online is Martin may have stolen up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/02/former-nsa-contractor-may-have-stolen-75-of-taos-elite-hacking-tools/">75 percent of the tools and software</a> used by Tailored Access Operations, the NSA&#8217;s elite hackers. Martin is expected to appear before a federal grand jury in Maryland next week.</p>
<p><strong>5. Hand it over, Google. </strong>A U.S. judge has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/04/google-told-to-hand-over-foreign-emails-in-fbi-search-warrant-ruling/">ordered</a> Google to turn over customer emails stored on foreign servers in compliance with a search warrant pertaining to domestic fraud. The order is noteworthy as it directly contradicts a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/court-wont-reconsider-doj-argument-in-microsoft-customer-data-case/">previous and near identical order</a> that Microsoft was able to successfully <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/microsoft-wins-second-circuit-warrant/">reverse </a>on appeal late last year.</p>

<p><span id="more-4659"></span></p>
<p>The contrast between the early days of the Trump and Obama administrations could not be greater. President Obama started with record high approval ratings around the world, including in Europe. President Trump began by cozying up to the anti-establishment nationalist Nigel Farage and set the United States on a course toward greater nationalism and protectionism. “America first” will rattle the transatlantic relationship and blunt the ability of United States and Europe to jointly lead in setting global rules based on universal values of open societies, rules-based trade, and human rights.</p>
<p>But those looking back to the Obama years as a high point of value-based cooperation are viewing history through rose-colored glasses. The U.S.-EU relationship was rocky, especially with respect to tech policy and ensuring that the rule of law is respected and transposed to online life. Whereas Europeans tend to consider privacy rights as non-negotiable, Americans are often quick to dismiss European concerns as over-regulation not in their economic interest.</p>
<p>The transatlantic relationship on tech policy matters was challenging even before President Trump. Tech executives were often quick to label any initiative under the EU’s Digital Single Market, a policy designed to harmonize rules across twenty-eight jurisdictions, as protectionism. Silicon Valley libertarians saw almost all policy as obstructionist and believed optimal outcomes could be engineered, not legislated. Companies benefitted from the failure of regulatory efforts to keep up with the speed of innovation. Even Edward Snowden’s revelations did not lead companies to reassess their approach to collecting Europeans&#8217; data, although they did create tensions with Washington. In the absence of legislation adapted for the digital age, U.S. and EU-based courts were left to determine whether breaking encryption is legitimate or whether an EU citizen’s Facebook data could be transferred to the United States in compliance with EU law.</p>
<p>Concern with the power of the surveillance state might have initially been tempered in the Bay area because President Obama was “their guy” and understood tech. With President Trump in the White House, that no longer applies. The benefit of having strong checks and balances to limit the power of both government and the private sector is hopefully clearer now for those in the Valley.</p>
<p>Americans seeking to put a check on the Trump administration by renewing their commitment to diversity, the rule of law, and open borders online and offline may find more allies in Brussels than in Washington. Silicon Valley’s ethos now seems more aligned with Europe’s values than those embodied in the Trump administration. This shared self-interest could form the basis of a new digital transatlantic relationship.</p>
<p>The form of this new relationship is starting to take shape. Tech giants are united <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-06/twitter-netflix-to-file-brief-opposing-trump-immigration-order">in pushing back</a> President Trump’s executive order on immigration. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/court-wont-reconsider-doj-argument-in-microsoft-customer-data-case/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/02/maybe-the-us-does-have-the-right-to-seize-data-from-the-worlds-servers/">Google</a> are leading the fight to limit the extraterritorial application of U.S. law by fighting overbroad seizure warrants. Nevertheless, more needs to be done. U.S. surveillance authorities still do too little to protect the universal rights of those beyond its shores. It remains unclear whether an individual’s rights are protected based on where they reside or where the company that collects their data is incorporated. Given the immense market power of U.S. tech companies, what happens in the United States will shape laws elsewhere.</p>
<p>The manner in which the United States defends online rights, in turn affects the ability of the United States and the European Union to set global norms together. It will be harder to promote net neutrality in developing economies if the new Federal Communications Commission chairman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/technology/trumps-fcc-quickly-targets-net-neutrality-rules.html">is committed to repealing its protections domestically</a>. It will be harder to promote shared norms for appropriate state behavior in cyberspace if the United States is not seen as abiding by them. Warmer relations with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/asia/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-rodrigo-dutert-kim-jong-un.html">illiberal governments</a> will make the case for liberal democracy a tougher sell.</p>
<p>With the president’s approval at <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/318433-poll-trumps-approval-rating-continues-to-slide">historic lows</a> and concerns about his policies growing, the digital transatlantic relationship must be shaped not by government-to-government ties, but rather through clusters of businesses, civil society groups and governments that share the same values. U.S. tech companies should join Europeans in their calls to ensure values such as fair competition, access to information, free speech and non-discrimination are upheld.</p>
<p>With the change in the White House, the promotion of these fundamental rights might not be a side-project or diversion from a tech company’s bottom line. On the contrary, it might in their own self-interest. The Trump administration may inadvertently re-align the U.S.-EU tech relationship in unexpected ways.</p>
