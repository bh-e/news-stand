The duo shared a 200-run stand for the fifth wicket to ensure India take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.</p><p>England skipper Eoin Morgan had later suggested that during Kohli's innings his team's plan had been to "bowl at the guy at the other end", a plan that came unstuck on this occasion as the guy at the other end, Jadhav, scored a hundred off 65 balls.</p><p>"It was disappointing how it panned out considering the start we had," the Guardian quoted Root as saying. "One thing we noticed is that early on he chanced his arm which you have to, I suppose, to get up near the run rate."</p><p>"We didn't get the opportunities to stick, and in hindsight if we could have slightly more individual plans to him then that could be a way to go. He got one just over third man and it looked like we were going to take a wicket at any stage in that five-over period after [MS] Dhoni got out," he added.</p><p>The England batsman further said that one thing which Kohli did was talk his partner (Jadhav) through it at the other end and helped him construct his innings.</p><p>"There was a lot of thought behind it and for us, that is something we've got to learn from," he said.</p><p>The 26-year-old also asserted that Kohli is one of the best when it comes to run chases.</p><p>"He's one of the best at run chases in the game, in fact he probably is the best at it. His record says he's got 15 hundreds chasing scores down now," he said.</p><p>"I'd love to sit and chat to him, but I've not had that opportunity yet. Definitely watching him go about his business there is a lot of thought behind it," he added.</p><p>The two teams will next meet on January 19 at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack.</p><p><i>Stay updated on the go with Sify Live Scores App. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sify.sports">Click here to download it for your device</a></i></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:117:"http://www.sify.com/sports/kohli-is-the-best-at-run-chases-england-need-a-better-plan-news-cricket-rbrgJIaadghda.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:126:"http://www.sify.com/sports/diploma-course-for-sports-training-to-be-launched-at-rohtak-sai-centre-news-news-rbrfKCefgjfib.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 00:16:00 +0530";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"Diploma course for sports training to be launched at Rohtak SAI centre";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:590:"<p>[India], Jan. 17 (ANI): Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has decided to launch diploma course for sports training in Sports Authority of India (SAI) centre of Rohtak on the pattern of Patiala.</p><p>Minister of State of Youth Affairs and Sports Vijay Goel announced this at the closing ceremony of the 21st National Youth Festival-2017 yesterday.</p><p>Urging the youth to utilise their energy for the development of the country and society, Goel said that they should participate in sports and recreational activities along with focusing on work and career-building.

Fans had almost lost their hopes after India lost four crucial wickets including of Dhoni, Yuvraj and Shikhar Dhawan. The 351-run target was looking difficult to achieve at that time. But I as an audience and as a sister was hoping to see his good performance with Virat," Suchita said.</p><p>Describing Kohli as the 'best' and an 'aggressive' batsman, Suchita insisted that she was glad to see her brother supporting the skipper equally well to help India chase down the target, which was also the fourth highest successful run chase in ODI history.</p><p>"Virat is the best batsman, finisher, as well as an aggressive batsman. I was confident that he will be able to put up good performance with Kohli. When he was nearing 100 runs, he was facing difficulty while running. Still he managed to build a 100-run partnership with Kohli and then a 200-run partnership. They were well supported by Hardik Pandya and Ravichandran Ashwin in their chase of 351-run target," she said.</p><p>The 31-year-old batsman, who notched up his second ODI century, played in an aggressive style as he smashed the England bowlers across the ground and hit 12 boundaries and four sixes. He scored the fifth fastest century and became the fourth Indian batsman to do so, joining the likes of Kohli, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh.</p><p>Jadhav, who was adjudged as the Man of the Match, in the post-match presentation ceremony had said, "It's a great feeling that I could win a game for my country in front of my home crowd, and in front of my family. If you can make your team win, make your country proud, that's the greatest feeling."</p><p>"I could play this long because of captain Virat Kohli. He has done it so many times, showing how to chase big totals. I missed many chances to bat with Virat and watch him bat closely in the past, so today was the chance. It is a special day for me.
